these RH values are calculated by using available thermodynamic data

Relationship between Activity Coefficient of Water And That of Solute Species
Consider a mixed aqueous solution containing n number of solute

species. Activity, ai , of solute i (i = 1, 2, ··· n) in such a solution is related to aw by the Gibbs-Duhem relation:

x w d (ln a w ) +  xi d (ln ai ) = 0
i =1

n

This relation is rewritten as

d (ln a w ) = - ( xi x w )d (ln ai )
i =1

n

where xw and xi are the mole fractions of water and solute i with of activity coefficient fi is given by

reference to the Raoult standard. The expression for d(ln ai) in terms d(ln ai)=d(ln fixi)=d(ln fi)+d(ln xi)=d(ln fi)+(1/xi)dxi

Substituting this equation into Eq. (1), following equation is obtained 2

(2)

Using the relation x w +  xi = 1
i =1 n

following equation is obtained dx w +  dxi = 0
i =1 n

Thus, Eq . (2) is rewritten as d (ln f w ) = - ( xi x w )d (ln f i )
i =1 n

By integration of Eq . (3) from xw=1 to xw=X , following equation is

The left hand side, LHS, of this equation is expressed as Thus, Eq. (4) is reduced to ln f w ( X ) = - 
i =1 n xw = X x w =1

LHS=ln fw(X) - ln fw(1)=ln fw(X)

Because (xi/ xw) in Eq.(5) is give as (xi/ xw) = (mi/M), then Eq. (5) is further reduced to ln f w ( X ) = - 
i =1 n xw = X xw =1

where mi is the molality of solute i and M is that of water (M =

Hence, it was estimated under the assumption that the activity coefficient of a given ion does not vary in the solutions with obtained for a strong electrolyte species (A+B-  +Az++ -Bz-): the same ionic strength [#ref05, 06]. Thus, the following equation is electrolyte solution, respectively. The value of fix is not available in

This indicates that the activity coefficient of each ionic species in the mixed electrolyte is assumed to be the same as in the single electrolyte solution with the same ionic strength and is given by Eqs. (10) and (11). Accepting this assumption, Eq. (16) is rewritten as

fx±(I) =[fx(Az+,I)+· fx(Bz-,I)-](1/) =[f(Az+,I)+· f(Bz-,I)-](1/)=f ±(I)

Thus, if fw of the solution containing only one electrolyte species is known, fw of the mixed electrolyte solution can be estimated.

To carry out the calculation of Eq. (12), the value of å in Eq. (10) must be determined in addition to those of C and D. The values for these parameters were found as follows. First, the relationship between f± and I was derived from the relationship between mean

The calculated results were fitted well with the available measured data, and it is confirmed that the RH value for mixed electrolyte solutions also can be estimated with available thermodynamic data. To confirm the relationships between chemical composition of water film and RH, amount of absorbed moisture was measured. Stainless steel sheets with area of 100cm2 and QCM, Quartz Crystal Microbalance, were covered with simulated sea salt, which contains NaCl and MgCl26H2O; m[Mg2+]/m[Na+] = 0.11 [#ref01], and were exposed in the constant humidity chamber for 2~4h. The amount of exposure. absorbed moisture, Wab, was determined as weight change during the The QCM was an AT-cut quartz crystal with gold platings on both sides.
