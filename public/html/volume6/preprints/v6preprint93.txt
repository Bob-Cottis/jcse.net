Abstract

In our earlier studies, thermal spray of Ni-Cr and Al coatings was attempted on modified 9Cr-1Mo steel, to evaluate their steam oxidation resistance. The results showed that the HVOF coating of 50Ni-50Cr showed an excellent performance against the steam oxidation till 750oC for 1000 hours. APS coating process for Ni-Cr exhibited the porous structure, which resulted in the scale growth at the coating/substrate interface and propagates with testing

temperature and duration. In the case of Al coating, though APS process could produce the dense coating, the diffusion of Al into the substrate was very fast and it resulted in the dissolution of the coating during the course of time. In the present investigation, APS coatings of 50Ni-50Cr as undercoat and Al topcoat were attempted with the aim that the pores produced by Ni-Cr can be filled with Al topcoat. For comparison purpose the thick 50Ni-50Cr coating (~450 µm) with sealant according to British standard (BS 5493) was also carried out. The results show that both the two-layer coating of Ni-Cr +Al and thick coating with sealant showed the excellent performance against the steam oxidation till 3000 hours of test. But it is interesting to note that the two layer coating showed the similar performance despite

their lower coating thickness compared to thick coating. Ni and Cr diffusion occurred into the Al coating structure. Al diffusion into the Ni-Cr system appears to be slower compared to Fe-Cr system.

Keywords: steam oxidation, Cr-Mo steel, Ni-Cr coating, Al coating, high velocity oxy fuel spray and atmospheric plasma spray.

Introduction

There is increased attention on the plant efficiency of fossil power plants to meet the stringent environmental regulations along with ensuring plant reliability, availability and maintainability without compromising the cost [#ref1], [#ref2]. Steam temperature is a key factor, which controls the plant efficiency and the emission gas. Increasing the steam operating temperature and pressure will proportionally increase the plant efficiency with reduction in the emission gas [#ref 3]. Material used in the power plant should withstand against creep and steam oxidation, while increasing the steam operating temperatures. The ultra-steel project at our institute aims to develop the material that can withstand the steam operating temperature of 650oC. The featured material should possess both creep and steam oxidation resistance along with ease of fabrication. The existing modified 9Cr-1Mo steel (ASME T91) suffers with severe oxidation and creep at this temperature [#ref4]. This necessitated the improved mechanical and oxidation properties of the material that can withstand the increased temperatures. There are several ferritic steels being developed. Many of these newly developed ferritic steels showed an improved creep properties but it has failed to exhibit sufficient steam oxidation resistance. . However, 3% Pd added CrMoWNbV steel developed at our institute showed an excellent steam oxidation resistance6). Addition of Pd promoted the Cr segregation at the surface to form Cr rich oxide at the surface. The higher Cr content present in

this scale minimize the further scale growth. However, the cost of this alloy is too high due to Pd addition. [#ref5].

Thermal spray coatings can be applied to overcome the steam oxidation problem since it alters the surface without affecting the bulk spray coatings for fossil power plants to improve the oxidation material properties. A few earlier attempts were made on the thermal resistance of the material though the thermal spray process is extensively used for gas turbine applications [#ref6], [#ref7]. Thermal spray coating of FeAl, FeCrAl and NiAl powders on 9Cr-1Mo steel was attempted to improve the steam oxidation resistance for USC boiler applications [#ref8]. In that, FeCrAl and NiAl showed the promising results. Also, the thermal spray was attempted for the super heater/re-heater components where the material severely suffers on fireside corrosion. The powder used for the study is Fe-Si intermetallics with the undercoat of NiCr alloy [#ref9].

In our earlier studies [#ref10-#ref14], thermal spray of Ni-Cr and Al coatings were attempted on modified 9Cr-1Mo steel. Two coating process namely high velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) spray and atmospheric

plasma spray (APS) were adopted. The results showed that HVOF coating of 50Ni-50Cr showed the excellent performance against the steam oxidation till 750oC for 1000 hours [#ref10-#ref12]. APS coating process exhibited the pores in the coating structure, which resulted in the scale growth at the interface [#ref10, #ref11, #ref14]. Whereas, Al coating produced by APS process could produce a dense coating structure on the modified 9Cr-1Mo steel substrate. But the diffusion of Al into the substrate is very high during the steam oxidation process. At 1000 hours of steam oxidation test, the coating structure is totally vanished due to the diffusion of Al into the steel matrix [#ref13].

With the summary of the earlier results, the new design of coatings was attempted with the consideration that high performance coating with less sophisticated process (also economical). APS coatings of study. For comparison purpose the thick 50Ni-50Cr coating (~450 µm) with sealant according to British standard (BS 5493) was also carried out. The post steam oxidized specimens were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), backscattered electron (BSE) image and energy despersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies in comparison with their respective as-coated specimens. 50Ni-50Cr as undercoat and Al topcoat were attempted in the present

Experimental

The 9Cr-1Mo type ferritic steel was used as a substrate specimen with following dimensions. 20mm (length) x 10mm (width) x 4mm (thick) specimens coated with 50Ni-50Cr and Al powders. Chemical composition of the substrate and powders are represented in Table 1. Thermal spray coatings were carried out using HVOF spray and APS processes to compare the performance of these two processes. The process parameters used for both coatings are given in Table 2.

Prior to the coating process, the specimens were sandblasted using alumina powder for better adhesion to the substrate. For coating A, totally fourteen passes were adopted which included two pre-heating passes, eight passes of Ni-Cr and four passes of Al. Thickness of the respectively. For coating B and C only Ni-Cr is used as the feed stock materials. The total passes given for both coatings are 40 passes including 2 pre-heating passes, which yielded the thickness of about 450 µm. After spraying the specimens B and C are applied with Metco® were cured for 4 hours at room temperature. Sample B is taken for the annealing treatment at 1050oC for 15 minutes to fill the pores of the 4 Sealant of about 40 µm on the surface of the coating. The samples coating obtained by Ni-Cr and Al are about 50 and 20 µm,

Ni-Cr coatings by the sealant. The summary of the coating process for all the three coatings and their thickness are given in Table 3. The coated specimens were supplied to XRD and SEM investigations before placing them into the steam oxidation chambers. Steam oxidation tests were carried out at different temperatures viz., 600, 650, 700 and 750oC. The procedure followed for the steam oxidation process

was described elsewhere [#ref10]. The sample pieces were taken out in different durations namely 1000 and 3000 hours of steam oxidation test. The surfaces of oxidized specimens were supplied to XRD to identify the new phases formed during steam oxidation in comparison with as-coated conditions. SEM/EDS studies were carried out on the cross sections to reveal their change in morphology and composition of the coating after the steam oxidation.

Figure 1 shows the BSE image cross sections of 50Ni-50Cr coatings produced by HVOF and APS process. The HVOF coating showed thick The coating appears to be less porous in nature. The APS coating showed the lamellar structure with higher porosity compared to the HVOF coating. The thickness of the coating was around 40 µm. and uniform coating. The thickness of the coating was around 60 µm.

Figure 2 depicts the BSE image cross sections of the 50Ni-50Cr coated specimens steam oxidized for 1000 hours. From the HVOF coatings, the BSE images showed a compact coating layer present on the substrate with neither scales nor de-lamination. There is no sign of scale initiation at the coating/substrate interface. The black layer

observed in the coating/substrate interface for 750oC steam-oxidized

specimen arise from the formation of chromium carbide is discussed

elsewhere [#ref11]. The APS coating oxidized at both 600 and 750°C showed the initiation of the scale at the interface. At 750°C, the scale incorporation in the coating as well as at the surface was noticed HVOF APS (indicated by arrow marks). The occurrence of scale growth at the interface for the APS coatings is attributed to the more porous coating structure than HVOF coatings. The steam can penetrate into the pores and reacted with the substrate surface resulted in the scale growth at the coating/substrate interface.

Figure 3 shows the BSE image for the cross section of Al coated modified 9Cr-1Mo steel specimens. The image shows that the 7

thickness of the coating is around 30-40 µm. The coating appears to be dense and less porous. In Ni-Cr coating, APS process showed variation in the thickness of the coating along with high amount of pores. But in the case of Al, the coatings showed neither non-uniform coating thickness nor porous structure. This suggests that APS could be a good process to produce the dense Al coatings.

Figure 4 shows the BSE image of specimens steam oxidized at different temperature at 1000 hours. At 600oC, the diffusion of Al into the steel substrate was around 10 µm. In the case of 650oC the diffusion of Al reached more than 20µm in the substrate region. Whereas, at 700 and 750oC tested specimens showed the total diffusion of the coating to the substrate. The top surface for both specimens showed the iron oxide layer along with traces of aluminium oxide revealed from the XRD studies [#ref13].

The XRD spectrum for coating A showed four prominent peaks in the measured 2 value of 20-800. All the four peaks observed in this region are indexed to the metallic Al. The X-ray could not penetrate undercoat the Ni-Cr since the thickness of Al top coating is around 20 µm. The coating B showed three major peaks along with several minor peaks. The spectrum showed the Cr bcc as a major peak along with Ni-Cr fcc peaks. However, in our earlier studies [#ref11], the as-coated specimens showed only Ni-Cr fcc peaks. The changes in phase as well as the appearance of several minor peaks are attributed to the annealing procedure of the coating B. The minor peaks are indexed for oxides of aluminum and chromium. The Al2O3 is originated from the sealant, which originally contains Al flakes dispersed into the organic solvents. The XRD spectrum for coating C showed all high intensity peaks, which are indexed to metallic Al and Ni-Cr fcc phase. Unlike coating B, no minor peaks were observed. Though the sealant thickness was aimed for 40 µm over the Ni-Cr APS coating, the sealant applied using wire brush, which, might have resulted in the partial coverage of the Ni-Cr coatings. The higher roughness of the Ni-Cr coating might also have limited the formation of uniform sealant layer. Hence, the appearances of Ni-Cr peaks were noticed for the XRD spectrum of coating C. In the case of coating A, the XRD spectrum showed only Al peaks despite their 20 µm thickness and could not yield the peaks for Ni-Cr undercoat indicated their uniform nature of the Al topcoat.

The coating A showed the two-layered structure contains Al topcoat and the Ni-Cr under coat. The Al topcoat appears to be dense and fully covered over the Ni-Cr undercoat. The total thickness of the coating is around 70 µm. In the case of coating B, the coating structure turned into dense structure and the sealant applied over the coating surface is almost vanished. The Al sealant might have diffused into the coating structure but the BSE image could not detect them. The concentration of diffused Al was found only in the few microns at top surface by EPMA studies. The coating C showed the lamellar structure of as-sprayed Niappears to be non-continuous in nature.

Figure 8 shows the BSE image cross sections of coating A steam oxidized at 750oC for different durations. At 1000 hours duration the Al topcoat showed the drastic change in their structure. The dense coating observed in the as-coated condition is transformed into to porous structure at the top surface along with formation of new layer with grain shaped structure at the underneath. The Ni-Cr undercoat appears to be intact. With increasing the oxidizing duration from 1000 hours to 3000 hours, the coating did not show major changes except the reduced grain type particle size with increase number of the newly formed phase at the interface of Al topcoat and the Ni-Cr undercoat. In both the cases, there was no iron oxide scale at the interface of steel substrate/coating. This infers the excellent protection of coating A against the steam oxidation resistance for modified 9Cr-1Mo steel substrate. EDS point analysis was carried out on the coating structure at five different locations. The locations analyzed are marked in Figure 8 and the results of the elemental composition are given in Table 4. From the results, the top surface of the coating contains oxides of aluminum with little amount of Ni and Cr. The beneath layer of the top 11

surface contains (point 2) major amount of aluminum oxide with minimum amount of chromium oxide. The grain type phase (point 3) appeared in the steam oxidized specimens contains the elemental composition of Ni and Al in the 3:1 ratio. This may be attributed to the formation of Ni3Al intermetallics. The point 4 represents the undercoat Ni-Cr but with reduced amount of Cr. The gray color layer observed at the inner splat basically arise from the separation of Cr phase from the Ni-Cr fcc phase and in the inner splat boundaries showed the oxides of chromium (point 6). EDS point analysis could not detect any Fe in the coating structure indicates excellent protection of the coating against the steam oxidation. As a summary, the Al topcoat over the Ni-Cr oxidation by forming Al2O3 and Cr2O3 on the surface of the coatings. undercoat structure effectively withstands against steam

Figure 10 shows the XRD spectra for coating B steam oxidized at 750oC for different durations. At 1000 hours of test duration the spectrum showed the Cr bcc as the major peak along with several Al2O3 and Cr2O3 peaks. But, the peak intensities for Cr2O3 is very small compared to Al2O3 peaks. With increasing the steam oxidation test duration, the Al2O3 peaks were getting suppressed and instead of that Cr2O3 peak was gaining their intensities. This phenomenon can be explained from the oxygen partial pressure required to form their form chromium oxide is around 10-25 Pa, whereas, Al required to form its oxide is only 10-40 Pa [#ref15]. This indicated that the Cr required higher oxygen partial pressure to form its protective oxide and Al oxide could be stable at a lower partial pressure beneath the chromium oxide. Thus, Cr diffuse over the Al layer and approached the surface to form the Cr2O3. respective oxides. At 750oC, the oxygen partial pressure required to

Similar observation was observed for the cross sections of coating C steam oxidized at 750oC for 1000 and 3000 hours durations, which is represented in Fig. 13. However, both the coatings exhibited the grey layers in the inner splat boundaries, might have arise from the oxide formation.

the top surface of the sealant (point 1), it contains major portion of aluminum oxide with below 1 wt% of Cr, possibly chromium oxide. The white layer observed in the sealant (point 2) also exhibited the Al oxide with decrease in the Cr content from 3 wt% to 1 wt%. The since the Al2O3 is the insulating in nature. The point 3 also showed the different contrast of the layer is attributed to the charging effect layer presence of Al oxide with 5.1 wt % of Cr. It indicated that chromium started diffusing towards the top surface to form the Cr2O3. This can be confirmed even from the XRD studies of specimens steam oxidized at 1000 and 3000 hours. the 1000 hours steam oxidized specimens showed the least intensities for Cr2O3 whereas the appearance of Cr2O3 peaks was noticed in the case of 3000 hours. In the longer duration the diffusion may lead to the dominant Cr2O3 layer at the tops surface. Below the sealant layer a thin grey layer observed (point 4) corresponds to the Cr oxide with 10 wt% of Al. The points 5, 6 and 7 are chosen from the Ni-Cr coating structure depending on their change in their phase and morphology. A light gray color pools observed across the Ni-Cr coating structure (point 5) are consists of Cr with very little amount of Ni. This indicated the phase separation from Ni-Cr fcc to Cr bcc phase.

showed the similar phenomenon of segregating in to the inner splat boundaries of 50Ni-50Cr HVOF coatings. From the EDS point analysis none of the points showed the presence of Fe indicated the absence of scale growth. As a summary, the thick 50Ni50Cr coating with sealant showed an excellent protection against steam oxidation till 3000 hours test duration.
