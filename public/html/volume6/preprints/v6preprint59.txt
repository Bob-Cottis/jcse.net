Abstract
The effects of sulphate (SO42-), thiosulphate(S2O32-) and hydrogen sulphate (HSO4-) ion additives on etching of pure aluminium (Al) foil for Al electrolytic capacitor have been investigated in 4 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution as a function of anion concentration using potentiodynamic polarisation experiment, galvanostatic potential transient technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. From the potentiodynamic polarisation curves and galvanostatic potential transients, it was observed that pit and etch tunnel initiation was inhibited by the addition of SO42- and S2O32- ions. In contrast, in the presence of HSO4- ions pit and etch tunnel initiation was enhanced. While galvanostatic potential transients resulting just after short current interruption in the presence of SO42and S2O32- ions showed no potential overshoot followed by a rapid showed an appreciable potential overshoot followed by a slow potential decay. This means that pit and etch tunnel growth is by the addition of HSO4- ions. Based upon experimental results, two types of mechanisms for increased surface area in the presence of SO42-, S2O32- and HSO4- ions are proposed: increase in surface area by enhancing growth rate of etch tunnels in the pre-existing pits in the presence of SO42-, S2O32- ions; increase in surface area by increasing accelerated by the addition of SO42- and S2O32- ions, but it is retarded potential decay, the potential transients in the presence of HSO4- ions

Introduction
Aluminium (Al) electrolytic capacitors are widely used in all types of with favourable economics. Since the capacitance of Al foil used in electrolytic capacitor is determined by its surface area, electrochemical etching process has been adopted to increase surface area. For high voltage application, DC etching which forms long etch tunnels is demanded rather than surface etching [1, 2]. Over the past few decades, a considerable number of studies have been made on the metal dissolution kinetics [3], the passivation of the oxide film in Al etch tunnels during the electrochemical etching [4] and the morphological study of Al etch tunnels by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [5, 6]. There are many factors which influence tunnel etching. Among them, the well discussed factors are the properties of Al foil such as impurities, grain size, cubicity and the properties of etching solution such as composition and temperature of etching solution and finally, etching time. In general, etching process is done in a hot chloride solution at etch pits form. Since the pit walls grow in five directions electronic equipment because they have wide working potential range

temperatures above 70°C. In the initial attack, crystallographic cubic simultaneously, the depth of etch pits is half the width at the surface [7]. When the pit width increases to about 1 µm, there is a change in growth morphology. The formation of etch tunnels from the existing etch pits and subsequent their growth along [100] direction occur [1]. change in morphology. Since the shape of etch tunnels is influenced In contrast, below 60 °C, etch pits coalesce into large pits without any by the additives in the solution, various additives for increased surface area have been employed. Among them, sulphate (SO42-) is the most common. In previous work [8, 9], the effect of sulphate ion additives on pitting corrosion of pure Al was investigated at room temperature

It was revealed that the addition of SO42- ions retards pit initiation and at the same time accelerates Al dissolution in the pits. In addition, the ) ion additive was also reported [10].

In the present work, effects of SO42-, S2O32- and HSO4- ion additives on electrochemical etching of pure Al foil were examined in 4 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution as a function of anion concentration using potentiodynamic polarisation experiment, galvanostatic potential transient technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results are discussed in terms of the changes in etch tunnel morphology and surface area in the presence of anion additives.

Experimental
The test specimen used in this work was high purity (99.99%), 120 µm thick aluminium (Al) foil. The chemical composition of the foil used in this study was determined by ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry) and is shown in Table 1.

The Al foil was pretreated before etching by immersion in 1 M NaOH solution at room temperature for 10 min to enhance uniformity of the distribution of tunnel lengths and widths [11]. In all electrochemical experiments, a platinum gauze and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Pitting potential, Epit, of Al foil in the absence of SO42-, S2O32- and

HSO4- ions was compared with that of Al foil in the presence of these ions by potentiodynamic polarisation experiments. Measurements were made at a scan rate of 0.5 mVs-1 in the applied potential range galvanostat/potentiostat.

Etching was carried out in 4 M NaCl solution containing various SO42-, S2O32- and HSO4- ion concentrations at 80°C at a constant current density of 100 mAcm-2. To investigate the effect of SO42-, S2O32- and

HSO4- ion addition on initiation and growth of pits and etch tunnels, the potential was recorded galvanostatically with time.

Electrochemical impedance measurements were conducted on the

Ac signal of 5 mV amplitude was superimposed on open-circuit potential at room measured impedance spectra were analysed using the complex nonlinear squares (CNLS) fitting method based upon the simple Randles circuit [12, 13]. The morphology of pits and etch tunnels was observed using the oxide replication technique [14]. Al was dissolved from the anodised foil by immersion in bromine-methanol solution. After that, the remained oxide replica was observed by using SEM. temperature over the frequency range of 10-1 Hz to 105 Hz. The

Results and Discussion
Fig. 2 presents the XRD pattern of Al foil obtained by theta-two theta scanning method for examining preferred orientation. In this figure, it was shown that the diffraction peak from (200) plane was the most dominant. Therefore, it is evident that the surface of Al foil mainly consists of (100) plans.

foil etched in 4 M NaCl solution at 80°C at an anodic current density of in the direction perpendicular to the surface of Al foil. Considering that etch tunnels grow preferentially along [100] direction in a hot chloride solution as mentioned in introduction, This is another indication that Al foil used in this work has (100) preferred orientation. Fig. 4 depicts anodic polarisation curves of Al foil with a scan rate of concentrations at 80 °C. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) showed that pitting 0.5 mVs-1 in 4 M NaCl solution containing various anion

concentrations increased. This implies that pit initiation is suppressed by the addition of SO42- and S2O32- ions. In contrast, Fig. 4(c) showed initiation is accelerated by the addition of HSO4- ions.

Fig. 5 demonstrates galvanostatic potential transients of Al foil

subjected to a constant anodic current density of 100 mAcm-2 in 4 M figure, the potential transients were divided into three stages: the

NaCl solution containing various anion concentrations at 80 °C. In this

initial increase in potential up to the maximum value in the first stage, the decrease in potential after the maximum in the second stage and the stabilisation of potential to a constant value in the final stage. The increase in potential in the first stage is associated with double layer charging and oxide growth, while the decrease in potential in the second stage is ascribed to the breakdown of oxide film and to subsequent pit and etch tunnel initiation. A constant value in potential in the final stage indicates the steady growth of pits and etch tunnels [15, 16]. Potential and time at the maximum are denoted as the maximum potential, Emax, and the induction time, ti, respectively.

indicates higher resistance to pit and etch tunnel initiation. In the case increased with increasing SO42- and S2O32- ion concentration as shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b). This implies that the initiation of pits and etch tunnels is more retarded in SO42-- and S2O32--containing NaCl solution of SO42- and S2O32- ion addition, it was found that both the Emax and ti

and etch tunnels occur at Emax and ti, higher value in Emax and ti

than in SO42-- and S2O32--free NaCl solution. In contrast, it was

observed that both the Emax and ti decreased with increasing HSO4- ion concentration as shown in Fig. 5(c). Therefore, it can be said that pits and etch tunnels are more easily initiated in HSO4--containing NaCl solution than in HSO4--free NaCl solution. Fig. 6 shows galvanostatic potential transients resulting just after current interruption in the double current step experiment in anionfree and anion containing 4 M NaCl solutions. In the case of anion-free 4 M NaCl solution, a significant potential overshoot was observed at the current interruption time of 0.04 s as shown in Fig. 6(a). This means that the time required for the passivation of pits and etch tunnels is at least longer than 0.04 s in the absence of anions. In the presence of SO42- and S2O32- ions (Figs. 6(b) and 6(c)), the potential

overshoot at the current interruption time of 0.08 s was higher than that in the absence. This is another indication that pit and etch tunnel initiation is suppressed in the presence of SO42- and S2O32- ions. However, at relatively short current interruption times, more

remarkably reduced potential overshoot appeared, followed by a more rapid potential decay compared with that in the absence. Considering that pits and etch tunnels become still active as the current interruption time decreases, it indicates that the addition of SO42- and potential overshoot at relatively short current interruption times in the presence of HSO4- ions (Figs. 6(d)) is higher than that in the absence, implying that the addition of HSO4- ions retards pit and etch tunnel growth. Summarising the results of Fig. 6, we can depict a schematic diagram of potential transients resulting just after current interruption as given in Fig. 7. The potential transients resulting just after current S2O32- ions accelerates pit and etch tunnel growth. In contrast, the

8

interruption appear in the following two forms: one is an appreciable

potential overshoot followed by slow potential decay (type A) and the other is no potential overshoot followed by rapid potential decay (type B). When pits and etch tunnels are entirely passivated during the current interruption, it is expected that the potential transient of type A appears. However, the potential transient of type B occurs when pits and etch tunnels are partly passivated and still active during the current interruption.

In Fig. 8 and 9, it was apparent that both the pit number density and the pit area density decreased as SO42- and S2O32- ion concentrations increased.

2. Galvanostatic potential transients resulting just after short current interruption in the presence of SO42- and S2O32- ions showed no potential overshoot followed by a rapid potential decay. In contrast, the potential transients in the presence of HSO4- ions showed an appreciable potential overshoot followed by a slow potential decay. This indicates the acceleration of pit and etch tunnel growth by the tunnel growth by the addition of HSO4- ions. 3. From the measured oxide film capacitance Cox obtained from the addition of SO42- and S2O32- ions and the retardation of pit and etch

impedance spectra of the anodised Al foil specimens, it was obviously shown that the addition of SO42-, S2O32- and HSO4- ions to a chloride solution increased the value of Cox. This is ascribed to the increase in

surface area due to the enhancement of etch tunnel growth in the preexisting pits in the presence of SO42- and S2O32- ions on the one hand and due to the increase in the pit number density and the pit area density in the presence of HSO4- ions on the other hand.
