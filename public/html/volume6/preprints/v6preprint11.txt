Abstract
(in air after passivation) nano-scratching tests were performed to the iron single crystal (100) surfaces passivated at 0.0 V ­ 1.0 V (SHE) in pH 8.4 borate solution to evaluate the friction coefficient of the passive surface and its potential dependence. The friction coefficient obtained with in-situ nano-scratching for the passive iron (100)

In-situ (kept potentiostatically in the passive state) and ex-situ

surface was significantly larger than that obtained with ex-situ nano-

scratching. The friction coefficient obtained with ex-situ nanoscratching was almost independent of potential in the passive region. On the other hand, the friction coefficient obtained with in-situ nano-

scratching increased with increasing potential in the passive region. These results were explained in terms of a series of mechano-

electrochemical reaction such as the film rupture, active dissolution and repassivation taking place at the moving front of the indenter during in-situ nano-scratching.

Introduction

electrochemical properties of passive metal surfaces correlate their mechanical properties to some extent [14-19]. If the correlation between chemical or electrochemical and mechanical properties is made clear, the mechano-electrochemical knowledge valuable for better understanding of the passivity breakdown and repassivation will be acquired. The recent development of nano-indentation or nano-scratching

technique has made feasible to evaluate the mechanical properties of friction coefficient [20-25]. In our previous studies [15,17-19], the

Experimental
Single crystal iron (100) disk-plate with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 1.4 mm were used for experiments. The iron specimen constant current density of 32 mA cm-2 in a mixture of 70 % HClO4 and was mechanically polished and then finally electropolished with a glacial CH3COOH (1 : 20) at 17 °C. The electrolyte solution employed specimen was performed with a potentiostatic polarization at 0.0 V ­ 1.0 V (SHE) for 1 h in pH 8.4 borate solution, after cathodic reduction of an air-formed film at a constant current density of ­30 µA cm-2 for 10 min. A small electrochemical cell made from Diflon was specially designed for in-situ nano-scratching test in solution. Platinum ring and wire were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

A conical diamond indenter with a tip radius less than 1 µm and an included angle of 90 degree was employed for nano-scratching and attached to a tungsten rod for use in liquid.

thickness (2 ­ 5 nm) of passive films as seen from the dashed line in Fig. 2. This means that the thickness of passive film does not significantly affect the friction coefficient, which is consistent with the no significant potential dependence of the friction coefficients obtained with ex-situ nano-scratching. In contrast, it seems difficult to explain the significant potential dependence of the friction account a series of mechano-electrochemical reaction which would scratching as discussed later.

The repassivation may be promoted by a potential difference between the iron substrate at the rupture sites and solution. The repassivation rate, therefore, increases with increasing film formation potential. The pile up of the passive film due to repassivation would provide the high impedance against the movement of the indenter tip to increase the friction coefficient.

Conclusions
nano-scratching tests for the iron (100) surface passivated at 0.0 V ­ 1.0 V (SHE) for 1 h pH 8.4 borate solution. The following conclusions were drawn from the in-situ and ex-situ

1) The friction coefficient obtained with in-situ nano-scratching for the passive iron (100) surface was always larger than that of obtained with ex-situ nano-scratching.

2) The friction coefficient of the passive iron (100) surface obtained
with in-situ nano-scratching increased with increasing the passive film formation potential. In contrast, the friction coefficient

obtained with ex-situ nano-scratching had no significant potential 10
