Abstract
Fe-20Cr-5Al, pack-aluminised Fe-30Cr model alloys and FeAl intermetallics have been oxidised in air under atmospheric pressure and isothermal conditions. The high temperature efficiency of the thermally oxide scales grown on these three materials were compared. The kp values deduced from the parabolic plots of weight gain curves showed that -Al2O3 composed the oxide scale on all samples oxidised at T>1000 °C. For lower temperatures, transient alumina phases are observed, except for the Fe-20Cr-5Al alloys, for which only -Al2O3 was characterised whatever the temperature up to 800 °C. The addition of a reactive element (Y or Y2O3) drastically improved the high temperature oxidation resistance of the tested materials, since the oxide growth rate decreased and the alumina scale adherence strongly increased. The oxide morphologies and the X-ray diffraction patterns helped to compare the high temperature behaviours under oxidant atmospheres.

Keywords: alumina-forming alloys, intermetallics, pack aluminisation, Al2O3 scales, reactive element, oxidation mechanisms.

Introduction
The high temperature resistance of steels is based on their capacity to form homogeneous, adherent and dense protective oxide scales. Alumina-forming alloys are good candidates to resist to high temperature oxidation atmospheres because alumina scales, especially -Al2O3, exhibit the expected properties [1]. Intermetallic compounds, in particular aluminides, have been developed more recently. They exhibit also excellent high temperature resistance because they form Al2O3 scales acting as diffusion barriers during the oxidation process at high temperature [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. The major problem encountered by intermetallic compounds is their brittleness, especially at room temperature, which creates difficulties during their production [8,9]. Another possibility to elaborate aluminides consists in introducing Al at the steel surface using an Al deposition technique. The pack cementation process has been commonly used to cover iron-based alloys and to form aluminides on their surfaces [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. The aim of this work is to compare the high temperature oxidation properties of Fe-20Cr-5Al, pack-aluminised Fe-30Cr model alloys and FeAl intermetallics. Isothermal oxidation tests in the temperature range from 800 to 1200°C have been performed to check their ability to form alumina scales with the expected protective properties. The use of two stage oxidation experiments under
16O 2

observation of transmission electron microscope (TEM) cross-sections and the use of more classical analytical techniques, as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), help to describe the high temperature oxide scale growth and to understand the differences observed between the tested samples. A particular attention will be paid to the role played by Y or Y2O3

Experimental

Fe-20Cr-5Al "model" steels were classically elaborated in laboratory conditions by melting route. They were called "model" alloys since they did not contain any minor elements to avoid the well known influence of alloying elements on the high temperature corrosion behaviour delete the sulfur effect [22,23,24,25,26,27], which was also

[19,20,21]. There was a low amount of sulfur (S>10ppm) in order to susceptible to drastically influence the high temperature behaviour. Yttrium was introduced as an alloying element in Fe-20Cr-5Al steels to get Fe-20Cr-5Al-0.1Y alloys. The intermetallic compounds were produced via Mechanically

Activated Field Activated Pressure Assisted Synthesis (MAFAPAS) technique [28]. It consisted in applying a mechanical pressure together with an electric field on mechanically activated powders. The complete process was described elsewhere [28,29,30,31,32] and yielded to obtain FeAl materials with controlled densification and nanostructure. Indeed, the density of the so-prepared FeAl samples was over 99 % with an average crystallite size of 40-80 nm. Yttria was added in FeAl intermetallics as dispersed particles during the mechanical activation of powders to obtain FeAl-0.1Y2O3 (wt. %). The quantity of yttria was determined according to the literature in order to avoid any

"overdoping" effect, generally observed when the reactive element content is too high in metallic materials [33].The aluminisation of Fe30Cr "model " alloys was carried out using the pack cementation tecnique which involved a pack mixture made of 15 wt.% Al, 3 wt.% NH4Cl and 82 wt.% Al2O3 powders. The metallic substrate was embedded in the pack mixture for 5 hours at 1000 °C under argon atmosphere, to avoid oxidation during the process. The surface of the phases. The aluminised zone was around 100 µm thick [34]. Yttria was introduced as a coating elaborated via the Metal-Organic Chemical Vapour described elsewhere [35]. An Y2O3 film of around 200 nm thick was Deposition (MOCVD) technique, which was completely so-coated steels was covered with (Fe,Cr)3Al and (Fe,Cr)Al intermetallic

The to understand the alumina scale oxygen isotope profiles were monitored by Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry (SNMS) mechanism [36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43]. The corrosion products were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a field emission gun (FEG) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analyser (EDX). The thermally grown oxides radiation (=0.154056 nm). were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using the K1 copper under 200 mbar pressure. The oxidant

Figure 3: Isothermal oxidation kinetic curves for FeAl intermetallics in air under atmospheric pressure. The kinetic curves of the FeAl intermetallic compounds oxidised at 800, 1000 and 1100 °C are shown in Figure 3. The kinetic curve at 800 °C obeys a parabolic law from the beginning of the oxidation process. At 1000 and 1100 °C, a rapid increase of the weight gain per unit area is observed during the first hour of oxidation, followed by a classical 1. For all tested samples, the kp values are close to each other. Note that the parabolic rate constant is lower for Fe-20Cr-5Al at 800 °C and for FeAl at 1000 and 1100 °C respectively. The effect of yttrium or yttria was tested at 1000 °C. The weight gain curves (Figure 4) clearly evidence that the addition of the reactive element or the reactive element oxide decreases the oxidation rate and the weight gain during 100 h oxidation, compared to the undoped materials (Figure 1 to 3). The single exception concerns the aluminised sample for whith the yttria coating applied after the pack cementation process and which exhibits faster oxidation kinetics and a higher weight gain, compared to the only aluminised sample (Figure 2). 7 parabolic shape.

Oxide scale characterisation The morphologies of the oxide scales formed on Fe-20Cr -5Al steels at 1000 °C and 1100°C are different. At 1000 °C, the oxide scale is largely convoluted with anchor points of the scale on the metallic substrate. Many spalled areas were observed all over the surface. At 1100 °C, the oxide surface remains flat with much spallation. The oxide scale fracture cross-section exhibits coarse grains with some needles on the oxide surface. For all tested temperatures (from 800 to 1200 °C), -Al2O3 was identified by XRD.

After 100 h at 1000 °C, the aluminised specimens are covered with small oxide grains. At 1080 °C, the oxide scale is slightly convoluted and still composed of small oxide grains. The oxide scale is mainly composed of -Al2O3 with transient alumina phases at T<1000 °C.

The FeAl intermetallic compound exhibits an "hairy" microstructure, since its surface is covered with thin needles after 100 h at 1000 °C in air. At 1100 °C, the oxide scale is composed of classical small 8

platelets. The XRD experiments clearly evidenced transient alumina phases at 1000 °C, whereas -Al2O3 was only detected at 1100 °C.

Discussion
The Fe-20Cr-5Al steels, aluminised Fe-30Cr steels and FeAl intermetallic compounds oxidation curves obey the parabolic rate law. T>1000 °C. At lower temperature, the Fe-20Cr-5Al steel exhibited a kp value two order of magnitude lower than the values determined for the aluminised steel and the intermetallics. Grabke et al. [44] exposed Arrhenius plots of kp together with the corresponding alumina phases formed on NiAl: -Al2O3 at T>950 °C, -Al2O3 at 850<T<950 °C and Al2O3 at T<850 °C. The comparison of our results to the Grabke's steels all over the temperature range (from 800 to 1200 °C), that Arrhenius plots evidences that -Al2O3 is formed on the Fe-20Cr-5Al kp values deduced from the parabolic plots are comparable for

transient alumina phases ( and ) grow at low temperature for the aluminised samples and the intermetallic FeAl compounds, whereas last specimens. These conclusions are confirmed by the observation of the oxide morphologies and above all by the XRD analyses, which identify transient alumina phases at low temperature for the aluminised steels and the FeAl specimens. Al2O3 is the main thermally grown phase for T>1000 °C on these two

The three tested materials possess better high temperature behaviour with the presence of yttrium or yttria, verifying hence the beneficial effects of the so-called reactive elements [45]. Note that for the aluminised steels, the way to introduce the yttria has a major influence on its high temperature oxidation performance. When it is introduced after the aluminisation process, the yttria coating does not improve the oxidation resistance; the oxidation rate and the weight gain during 100 h oxidation tests are higher, compared to those of the undoped aluminised samples. This detrimental phenomenon was already observed [33,46,47] and attributed to an "overdoping" effect and bad

Conlusions
The oxidation behaviour of Fe-20Cr-5Al steels, pack cemented aluminised Fe-30Cr steels and FeAl intermetallic compounds were tested in air between 800 and 1200°C. Kinetic results and XRD characterisation evidenced that the alumina scales were composed of (-Al2O3 and -Al2O3) were identified at lower temperature (T<1000 °C) for the aluminised and the FeAl specimens. -Al2O3 was the main phase even at 800 °C for the Fe-20Cr-5Al steel. The introduction of yttrium or yttria gave the well known reactive element effect, which consisted in decreasing the oxidation rate and improving the oxide scale adherence. For the aluminised samples, the beneficial effects were observed when the yttria coating was applied prior to the aluminisation. Outward diffusion of aluminium and inward diffusion of oxygen constituted the main diffusive specie paths during the growth of the alumina scales at 1000 °C. The comparison of the preliminary results clearly evidenced that pack aluminisation or the use of FeAl intermetallic could replace FeCrAl steels in order to form protective alumina scales, even if it is obviously -Al2O3 at high temperature (T>1000 °C).
