Abstract
A new technique, Exfoliation of Slices in Humidity (ESH), was developed for the determination of exfoliation corrosion (EFC) susceptibility and quantification of EFC kinetics. Two AA7178 plates taken from the wingskin of a retired KC135 airplane were used as test samples. Samples were pretreated by potentiostatic polarization in chloride solution, during which they developed a corrosion morphology of combined sharp IGC and selective grain attack. exposure to high humidity after pretreatment of properly oriented and unconstrained samples resulted in the development of EFC. The EFC kinetics were determined by measuring the width of the unattacked region of the sample. The different behavior of the two plates during outdoor exposure at Daytona Beach was reflected by the ESH results. These results show the capability of the ESH test to discriminate between plates of varying susceptibility and to quantitatively determine EFC rates. Keywords: Al alloy, exfoliation corrosion Subsequent

Introduction
Exfoliation corrosion (EFC) is a form of intergranular corrosion that occurs on susceptibility of Al alloys to EFC can be assessed by exposure testing. ASTM G34, known as the EXCO test, involves exposure to an oxidizing acidic chloride the surface of wrought aluminum alloys with elongated grain structures. The

solution and comparison of the resulting surface to standard photographs [1,2]. Other tests involving exposure to aggressive environments have been devised, including the ASSET and MASTMAASIS tests [3,4]. The behavior of Al alloys in these accelerated environments has been correlated to long term exposure in less-aggressive natural environments [5-8]. Determination of EFC kinetics is tests exist for determination of EFC rates. Robinson and coworkers have used a [9-11]. useful for the development of predictive failure models, but no standardized deflection technique to quantify exfoliation extent and determine EFC kinetics specimens having undergone EFC is determined from their compliance under four-point bending. measurements.

pretreatment, the sample was rinsed with DI water and placed in a humidity chamber, consisting of a sealed beaker containing a saturated salt solution at room temperature (22-25C). Several salts were used to create a range of constant humidity: sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl),

potassium iodide (KI), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and calcium chloride (CaCl2). reported in the CRC Handbook [12] and the values measured by an RH meter were close, as shown in table1.

Following the electrochemical pretreatment, the samples exfoliated when exposed to a high humidity. The EFC started at the outer edges and moved inward. The contrast between at the boundary of the outer exfoliated and inner unattacked regions was sufficient to allow tracking of the EFC kinetics by analysis of digital photographs of the sample taken through the glass walls of

Exfoliation tests of "good" and "bad" 7178 samples were performed in different humidities created by saturated aqueous solutions of the salts in the above progress of exfoliation corrosion. Detailed metallographic analysis was performed on T, S, and L sections of the "good" and "bad" plates. Samples were polished down to 1 micron and etched by Keller's etchant. table.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows images of the "good" and bad plates from the AA7178 wingskin sample exposed to 96% RH for 0-52 days following electrochemical pretreatment.

transverse face of the microstructure) of both good and bad samples upon exposure to 96% RH. This deliquescence is evidence of the chloride corrosion product deposited in the microstructure during the electrochemical pretreatment. The kinetics of EFC can be determined by measuring the change in width of the central unexfoliated region. Regions with different rates of attack are evident as shown in figure 3. The EFC started out slowly, about 0.01 mm/day. Then,

after some delay time on the order of 2 weeks, the rate increased to a higher value, about 0.03 mm/day. then decreased again to a lower value of about 0.005 mm/day. This indicates that there is a susceptible layer inside the plate near the surface. different behavior of the two plates during outdoor exposure at Daytona

The critical humidity for EFC propagation seems to be just positions along the axis of each sample for RH values from 65-96%. Above 49% RH, samples exfoliated more severely with
