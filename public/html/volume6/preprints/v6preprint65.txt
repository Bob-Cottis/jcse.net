Abstract

The air oxidation of three Co-Ta alloys containing 15, 30 and 45 wt.%Ta was investigated with a thermobalance at 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800°C. In all tests the oxidation kinetics followed the parabolic rate law with the exception of Co-45Ta alloy oxidized at 800°C. The activations energies were found to be close for Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta alloys (136,11 and 128,83 kJ/mol, respectively), while for Co-45Ta it was obtained a smaller value of 98,72 kJ/mol. The oxidation morphologies of Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta alloys are very similar. An external scale of Co3O4 characterizes them for 600 and 650°C and a duplex Co3O4/CoO scale for 700, 750 and 800°C, accompanied by an internal oxidation zone (IOZ), in which both metallic phases suffered oxidation. The Co-45Ta alloy displayed a different morphology characterized by the presence of an external monolayer for all oxidized coupons. At 600, 650 and 700°C the monolayer is CoO, whilst at 750 and 800°C this is Co3O4 Beyond the monolayers, the coupons of Co-45Ta oxidized at temperatures higher than 700°C presents a zone of internal oxidation in which only the Ta-rich phase was oxidized.

Introduction
candidate Refractory metals bearing alloys have been considered as materials for high-temperature sulphur containing atmospheres. Alloys containing Mo and Nb have been tested for this purpose(1,2). Alloys containing Ta, in particular Co-Ta alloys, also have

been considered for this purpose, but so far only their resistance in oxygen bearing atmospheres has been evaluated. The oxidation of binary Co-Ta alloys (10 and 15wt.%Ta) as well as of the same alloys containing carbon (up to 1wt.%C) was investigated by El-Dahshan and Hazzaa(3) in pure oxygen and in air, at additions reduce the oxidation rate of Co more efficiently than Cr additions. The oxidized alloys exhibit an external monolayer of CoO CoTaO4. The beneficial effect of Ta was attributed to the formation of activity at metal/oxide interface, blocking its inward diffusion. alloys and concluded that the positive effect of Ta is due to the from the external layer through the following reaction: 5 CoO + 2 Ta Ta2O5 + 5 Co Voitovich(4) apud El-Dahshan and Hazzaa(3) investigated similar and a multi-phase porous internal layer composed of CoO, Ta2O5 and CoTaO4, which would be responsible for the reduction of oxygen

Its aim was to obtain further information on Co-Ta alloys behaviour in hightemperature air atmosphere so as to better understand the oxidation mechanism of these two-phase materials. In the original investigation intermediate temperatures of 650°C and 750°C were included in the original study in an attempt to obtain two extras experimental points for the sketch of Arrhenius plots. It was not paid much attention on the morphologies of these new coupons, which are expected to be similar to at least one of the neighbor temperatures produced coupons. Co-Ta alloys were oxidized only at 600°C, 700°C and 800°C(6). The

Test coupons oxidized at 600°C and 650°C develop a monolayer of scales are formed with Co3O4 being the outermost and CoO the innermost layer, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. The internal scales have a two-phase microstructure, resembling that of the alloys, i.e, the spatial distribution of the oxide phases is exactly the same as that at the metallic phases present in the alloys before its oxidation (see Figs. 9 and 10). The EDS analysis has shown that both metallic phases of the alloys were oxidized, being this type of oxidation known as heterophasic region - HR. The stoichiometric analysis of HR showed that the cobalt-rich phase was transformed to CoO, while the the Co-15Ta alloy and CoTaO4 for the Co-30Ta alloy. The XRD analysis of Co-15Ta alloys detected CoTa2O6 in the coupons oxidized intermetallic phase was converted to the double oxide Co4Ta2O9 for

at 600°C and 650°C and this double oxide together with Co4Ta2O9 in the three other coupons, whilst for all Co-30Ta coupons no double oxides were detected. These different data supplied by EDS and XRD may indicate that, instead of double oxides, tantalum-rich phase could have formed a mixture of Ta2O5 plus either CoO or metallic Co, at least in the coupons which fail to reveal the presence of double oxides when analyzed by XRD. All Co-45Ta coupons displayed an external monolayer (see Figs. 11 and 12), in a way similar to that of Co-15Ta tested at the two lowest temperatures. For coupons oxidized at 600°C, 650°C and 700°C the EDS analysis indicated that this monolayer is CoO, while for the coupons oxidized at the two higher temperatures this monolayer is Co3O4. The formation of these two cobalt oxides was confirmed by XRD analysis. Moreover, the oxidation at 750°C and 800°C produced a thick internal oxidation zone (particularly for the highest temperature = 57 700°C, but very thin (5 µm) (see Fig. 11). The morphology of this internal scale is different from that observed on Co-15Ta and Co30Ta alloys, indicating that only the intermetallic phase was internally oxidized in the Co-45Ta alloy, i.e., an internal oxidation zone - IOZ. However, in a similar way to these alloys, the internal scale of Co-45Ta alloy shows no spatial distribution difference when compared to the metallic alloy. The XRD analysis of oxidized Co-45Ta specimens detected some nitrogen-containing phases: tantalum nitrides (TaN, Ta2N and Ta4N) and Co(NO3)2. These phases were not identified in the scales because EDS microprobe was used to analyze only Co, Ta and O. µm) (see Fig. 12), which is also observed on the coupon oxidized at

Kinetics from total scale thickness: In order to allow the determination of the oxidation kinetics from the measurement of scale thickness, it was first tried to compare the thickness of the different observed layers. For the reason of the large morphological variance among the tested coupons, it was not possible to establish the comparison as originally though. The only way to do the scale thickness' comparison is to consider the total scale of each tested coupon. Table 3 lists the total scale thickness (t) of all tested coupons. Based on these, Arrhenius plots are drawn for each alloy (Figs. 13 to 15), which allow the calculation of the oxidation energy activation obtained correlation coefficient r2. derived from scale thickness ­ Qt.

Discussion
As was already stated there is a significant difference in oxidized scale morphology between the Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta alloys and the Co-45Ta alloy. The main difference is the type of internal oxidation that was formed in these alloys, since in the latter only the Ta-rich phase is oxidized. oxidized by the inward diffusion of oxygen this type of internal oxidation of two-phase alloys is called "diffusionless" or "in situ" or "in place" internal oxidation(9,10). The inward oxygen diffusion causes a progressive drop of oxygen partial pressure. At a certain depth the oxygen partial pressure is not sufficient to oxidize Co but can still oxidize Ta, since the latter is more reactive (less noble) than Co. In the internal oxidation zone (IOZ) of alloys Co-15Ta and Co30Ta both metallic phases were oxidized. This implies that the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction front is higher than the dissociation pressure of CoO. This type of internal oxidation may also produce another more internally located IOZ. This second IOZ is characterized by a morphology in which only the phase that contains the most reactive element is oxidized such as the one observed in Co-45Ta alloy. Nevertheless, this second IOZ was formed in neither Co-15Ta nor Co-30Ta alloys. The absence of this second IOZ is an indication of a possible obstruction of oxygen by the actual IOZ. This obstruction is certainly related to the nature of the oxidation products of this layer, which suppress oxygen diffusion through the first IOZ. When no metallic diffusion occurs and only one alloy element is

15

Another factor, which could have contributed to the different type of internal oxidation shown by Co-45Ta alloy, is the volume fraction of Ta rich phase (3), which is approximately 90%. Even if oxygen partial pressure is sufficient to oxidize Co, the much bigger 3-volume fraction determines a greater possibility for oxygen to meet Ta than Co. Moreover, there is also the kinetics factor. If the growing observed at conditions of high oxygen pressure), then Ta oxides may grow and coalesce, isolating Co rich phase from oxygen attack. For this mechanism to be operative there is a need of a minimum volume fraction of 3, i.e., there must be a critical volume fraction of Ta rich phase to suppress the oxidation of Co. This critical 3-volume fraction seems to be between that found in Co-30Ta alloy (IOZ characterized oxidizes). The oxidation kinetics of Co-45Ta alloy at 800°C was found to be intermediate between linear and parabolic (slope of 0,8 on the dilog plot). This result reveals the greater aggressiveness of corrosion of Co-45Ta at 800°C when compared to the other test temperatures. A highest test temperatures (750 and 800°C) points out a considerable morphological difference between them, both for external and internal scales. At the lower temperature the external monolayer is comparison of Co-45Ta coupons oxidized at 700°C and at the two by the oxidation of both metallic phases) and Co-45Ta alloy (only 3 rate of Ta oxides is greater than that of Co oxides (what is normally

essentially CoO whilst at the two highest temperatures it is Co3O4. Nevertheless it is not believed that only this difference should impose such distinct kinetics behaviour. A striking difference is also observed between the IOZ's; while for the coupon oxidized at 700°C it is only 5 µm thick, for the coupon oxidized at 800°C it is 42 µm thick. This large difference cannot be explained only in terms of different test temperatures, even though one assumes that the IOZ growing is controlled by inward diffusion of oxygen, which is a thermally activated process. It seems to be more reasonable to connect the more aggressive kinetics at 800°C to the nature of the external monolayer. being showed the same morphology of the alloy after oxidation at 800oC. This information could be interpreted as being contraditory, since it was expected for these two oxidation temperatures to produce 16 Co-45Ta oxidized at 750oC followed the parabolic rate law in spite of

similar kinetics, in agreement to the observed similar morphologies. Nevertheless a careful examination of the Co-45Ta oxidation kinetics' with is more than the double of the one for 700oC. Apparently, the reveal that the parabola obtained at the temperature of 750oC has a kp oxygen diffusion through Co3O4 is much easier than through CoO.

coupons the thickness of external layers are 13.5 and 16.6 µm, respectively, while for 700°C coupon it is only 6.3 µm. The literature data(11) states that the oxygen diffusion

This conclusion is supported also by the fact that for 750oC and 800°C

in CoO it is 8.8 x 10-4 exp (-287(kJ/mol)/RT) m2/s. This data for CoO there is no information as to the temperature range in which it is valid. However, if we assume that these values are valid at 800ºC, then the

oxygen diffusion coefficients for Co3O4 and CoO would be 3.56 x 10-14 m2/s and 9.41 x 10-18 m2/s, respectively. This is in agreement with the above finding. 750oC and 800°C in substitution of CoO monolayer formed at lower consideration the Ta doping effects on cobalt oxides. The obtained activation energy calculated from the mass-gain data (Qp) for each studied alloys (Table 2) shows smaller values for progressively more Ta concentrated alloys, which means that the higher the Ta content the less sensitive to temperature is the alloy. The same analysis based on the activation energies calculated from the a bias, as shown in Table 4. average total scale thickness (Qt's) was not possible, due to the lack of The reasons for Co3O4 monolayer formation on Co-45Ta alloy at

temperatures and revealed a significantly smaller value compared to the two other alloys. The calculation of Qt for Co-45Ta alloy led to a according to Table 4. value extremely close to Qp, which is only 0.02% smaller than Qt, The observed similarities between Qp and Qt for Co-45Ta must

be related to the nature of its internal scale, which is an IOZ. Depending on the oxidation temperature, the tested coupons formed an IOZ, which thickness corresponds to almost 70% of the total scale thickness. Differently, the HR thickness measured in Co-15Ta and Co30Ta alloys are never thicker than the corresponding external scale (i.e., HR thickness participates of less than 50% of the total scale thickness). Although thick, the contribution of the IOZ to the massgain of Co-45Ta alloy is not so significant as the one of the HR experimented by Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta, since only Ta is internally oxidized. The different nature of the internal scale formed in Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta (HR) and Co-45Ta (IOZ) determined the impossibility to correlate Qp and Qt in a comprehensive manner.

Conclusions
· ·

· · ·

All coupons, except the alloy Co-45Ta oxidized at 800°C, follow the parabolic rate law. The close activation energy values (both Qp and Qt) for oxidation of Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta alloys, as well as their similar morphologies, suggest the existence of a unique oxidation mechanism for these alloys. In the internal oxidation zone (IOZ) of Co-45Ta alloy only the Tarich phase suffers oxidation, while in the IOZ of the other two alloys both metallic phases are internally oxidized (HR). The different nature of the internal scale observed in Co-15Ta and Co-30Ta alloys (HR) in comparison to Co-45Ta (IOZ) preclude the correlation of Qp and Qt in a comprehensive manner. On Co-45Ta alloy oxidized at 600°C, 650oC and 700°C a CoO monolayer is formed, while on the alloy oxidized at 750oC and 800°C Co3O4 replaces this oxide. Moreover much thicker IOZ's are formed in the latters, which appears to be a consequence of the nature of their external monolayer. The authors are grateful to FAPESP for the funding of present
