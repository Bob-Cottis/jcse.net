Abstract

Advanced copper alloys are used as liners of rocket thrusters and nozzle ramps to ensure dissipation of the high thermal load generated during launch, and Cr-lean coatings are preferred for the protection of these liners from the aggressive ambient. It is shown that adequate protection can be achieved with thin Cu-Cr coatings containing as little as 17 % Cr.

Key words: Cu-Cr, coatings, oxidation, blanching, protection, Cr2O3

Introduction

The excellent thermal conductivity of copper alloys makes them preferred liner materials for rocket engine combustors and nozzle ramps, where conductivity of 300 W/mK (at 20oC), the highest for any material; and comparable values for the advanced Cu alloys being considered for liner application (CuCrNb, CuAgZr, and ODS Cu-Al2O3) are 300-360 W/mK [3], representing a low-to-moderate 6-23% drop from Cu. However, the poor resistance of Cu and its alloys to oxidative degradation needs to be overcome. One solution is the development of special copper alloys with better oxidation resistance, a good example being Cu-8Cr-4Nb [1,2]. Another is the use of an environmental-barrier coating, provided the coating material does not seriously impair thermal conductivity (and ductility) of the liner alloy. dissipation of a huge thermal load is important. Pure Cu has a thermal

Cu-Cr coatings are favored because they can provide a protective Cr2O3 scale upon oxidation, while maintaining good chemical match as well as acceptable thermal match with a Cu-alloy substrate. Ken Chiang and his layer from Cu-30vol.%Cr coatings on Cu alloys [4-6]. NiCrAly is another candidate coating material. Though its intrinsic thermal conductivity is lower than that of Cu-Cr compositions, it enables liner service at higher wall temperatures, while its preferential oxidation to Al2O3 (when its Al content exceeds ~5%) yields an even more protective oxide scale. Our aim was to develop Cu-Cr coatings to protect Cu alloys via adequate formation of Cr2O3, while keeping Cr content low enough not to impair ductility or thermal conductivity of the system. A rough, rule-of-mixtures estimation shows that thermal conductivity of a Cu-30%Cr composition should be ~240 W/mK, only 60% of the value for pure Cu, and 20-35% reduce this deficit of thermal conductivity ­ by reducing its Cr content while preserving its ability to provide Cr2O3 cover. A straight-forward way to do it is to make the coating fine-textured and homogeneous. The coatings studied by Chiang et al. were rather coarse aggregates of Cu and Cr particles. Of course, oxidation would yield Cr2O3 co-workers have demonstrated the formation of a continuous Cr2O3 sub-

islands which conform to the same texture but coalesce eventually into a continuous Cr2O3 layer. That is perhaps why they needed 30% and higher Cr levels to achieve protection. Advanced coating techniques now enable

the routine deposition of coatings with fine microstructures. Accordingly, one goal of this work was to demonstrate that Cr-lean coatings can be put down on Cu alloys from powder, using plasma spray or cold spray.

Experimental Details

The coating compositions used in our study were Cu-8.5Cr, Cu-17.1Cr, Cu-21.3Cr, and Cu-25.6 Cr (Cr content in wt %). They were deposited from corresponding powders by low-pressure-plasma spray (LPPS) or by a variant of cold-spray called "kinetic metallization" (KM). The powders, -

Results and Discussion

Results presented here for coatings on Cu-8Cr-4Nb were similar to those obtained with corresponding coating on Cu-3Ag-0.5Zr (the current Space Shuttle Main Engine liner). So, substrate details did not affect the results. LPPS coatings were brownish due to oxygen pick-up, and turned black upon anneal as the oxygen was incorporated into oxide. In contrast, KM coatings retained their color and luster through deposition and anneal, indicating they were significantly oxygen-free. Accordingly, the rest of just to highlight an advantage of cold deposition for Cu alloys.) Fig. 1 shows a KM-coated sample after 10hr oxidation at 650oC.

The histograms illustrate two key facts. The first is that coating reduces oxidation weight gain, by up to a factor of 4 compared with the uncoated alloy; indeed, the kinetic plots below the histograms illustrate the large differences in oxidation rates (i.e. in slopes) between the bare and coated alloy. The second is that the greater the Cr content of the coating, the more effective it was in reducing weight gain. A third fact, perhaps more interesting than the first two, is evident in the kinetic plot: For the coated samples, up to 80% of the net weight gain was registered in the first ~1.5 set in. Fig. 1(b) also shows that after 1 hr. the coated sample has gained 30% more weight than the uncoated substrate: Oxidation weight gains in the pre-parabolic stage were consistently higher for the coated samples than for the bare alloy, a result that is contra-intuitive. This seeming anomaly is explained by a point made earlier. The Cr2O3 hours, when parabolic kinetics associated with protective Cr2O3 had not

layer starts as discrete nuclei, hence a coarse distribution of Cr will result in a coarse distribution of nuclei. Only when these nuclei coalesce into a continuous Cr2O3 layer does it become a protective diffusion barrier. Up to that point, oxidation of Cu in the coating proceeds unabated. Hence, it is strongly influenced by coating texture. While post-deposition heat the early-stage oxidation produces by far the most weight gain because treatment may consolidate the coating in the sense of improving particle

adhesion and cohesion, it is unlikely to alter the texture. Coating texture is ultimately determined by the size of particle aggregates or "splats" that strike the substrate during deposition. This size factor may be improved by going to finer powders; however, the handling and delivery of very fine powders are not easy tasks. Apart from the coating texture, there may be inhomogeneity in the Cu-Cr distribution carried over from the powder; this is evident in Fig. 1. These inhomogeneities in coating textural and and oxidation protection becomes established. Fig. 2(a) shows also that above ~8%Cr and at temperatures below 750oC, coating composition did not significantly affect sample weight gain. The reason for this is evident in Figs. 3 and 4.

on a sample after oxidation at 650oC. (Inset is a low-magnification image that includes the alloy substrate as well.) This figure shows a filamentous early network of Cr2O3 just above the alloy substrate, separated from the copper oxide layers by a zone of friable material. (By analogy to similar features found in oxidized Cu-8Cr-4Nb [1,2], this zone is though to be highly porous Cu2O.) Fig. 4 shows the same alloy coated with Cu-17.1Cr (a), and Cu-25.6Cr (b), and oxidized at 650oC. A robust and continuous Cr2O3 layer is evident in both images. Thus, from the standpoint of Cr2O3 protection, there is no obvious advantage in Cr contents above ~17%. The question of whether the Cr reservoir in a Cu-17.1Cr coating is enough to sustain Cr2O3 growth is really a matter of the service life desired. For a space launch thruster, 10 hrs. of cumulative service (which represents hundreds of missions) is quite a long life.

Cyclic Oxidation Oxide films on these coatings and on the Cu-Cr-Nb substrate tended to spall off upon cooling; hence, resistance to cyclic oxidation is considered an important metric of performance, especially if a substantial thickness of oxide can build up during service. Cylic oxidation results for Cu17.1Cr and Cu-21.3Cr coatings on Cu8Cr4Nb are illustrated in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5(a) is a chart of weight gains at 750oC; the numbers in parentheses within the legend refer to repeat experiments. The Cu-21.3%Cr coating did not show any weight loss at 750oC; hence there was no necessity to explore higher-Cr coatings. The Cu-17.1Cr coating began losing weight after ~3.5h at 750oC; after 10h it was down to 90% of its starting weight. At 650oC and below, none of the coatings registered any weight loss. In a separate experiment [7] the substrate alloy, Cu-8Cr-4Nb, was found to and other Cu alloys were found to have lost significantly more weight. cyclic-oxidation degradation is obvious. Fig. 5(b) shows the surface appearance of the samples after 40 oxidation the Cu-17.1Cr coating after exposure at 750oC: The oxide cover became have lost 15% of its initial weight after similar oxidation cycles at 650oC; Hence, the effectiveness of these Cu-Cr coatings in protecting against

cycles at various temperatures. The only visible degradation appeared on breached around the edge and center hole, no doubt causing weight loss to begin in the 4th hour (Fig. 5a). Since temperatures at the wall are not approximating a worst-case cyclic-oxidation scenario. Oxidation-Reduction Cycling This aspect of the study was intended to determine how Cu-Cr coatings "blanching" (which is elaborated elsewhere [1,2] and in the companion paper [7]). Behavior in a cyclic oxidation-reduction test was considered an indicator of blanching resistance. The controls in this study were the alloys 3Ag-0.5Zr and Cu-8Cr-4Nb. The former exhibits no net change of weight in oxidation-reduction cycling and emerges with deep surface pits and fissures similar to features seen on this alloy after blanching attack in service; the latter registers a monotonic weight gain due to the growth of a protective oxide cover that resists reduction [7]. Fig. 6 summarizes the results of oxidation-reduction cycling for Cu-Cr. Fig. 6(a) plots weight change versus time for the three Cu-Cr coatings in the legend; all three behaved very similarly.

Note, however, that this result was obtained at 800oC. It is not known what would happen at lower temperatures (say, 600oC), where the growth of Cr2O3 is quite sluggish, while the growth of more easily reduced copper oxides is comparably brisk. This point is under investigation.

Summary and Conclusion:

To assess their effectiveness as environmental barriers for Cu alloys, CuCr coatings were tested for resistance to three categories of oxidationrelated degradation: (1) static oxidation in 2.2% O2, (2) cyclic oxidation in

air, and (3) oxidation-reduction cycling (in air and 5%H2 environments). Cu-17.1Cr was found to be borderline adequate, whereas Cu-21.3Cr and Cu-25.5Cr were superior. But since Cu-21.3Cr and Cu-25.5Cr showed about the same level of resistance to degradation in all categories, there would be no need to go above 21.3%Cr content, in view of the attendant deficit in coating ductility and thermal conductivity. Further improvement may come from refining the coating texture and also homogenizing its composition. Using finer (<10-micron) powders and co-deposition of elemental Cu and Cr rather than pre-blended Cu-Cr powders are two ways to go. These approaches will be explored in future work.
