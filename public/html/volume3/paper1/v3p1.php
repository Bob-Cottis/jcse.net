<p>Amorphous chromium deposit has been prepared by
electrodeposition technology. The amorphous structure of the deposit was
examined by XRD and TEM. The deposit was spontaneously passive showing a
significantly lower corrosion rate in comparison with conventional chromium
deposit in 1 mol/L HCl and 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> Solutions. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of passive film shows that the passive film
formed is similar to conventional chromium deposit and mainly consist of
chromium oxyhydroxide.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>An amorphous material lacks the long range atomic
order characteristic of a crystalline material; only short range order exists
over a few atomic distances (15 � 1A). They are primarily composed of metallic elements
and the interatomic bonding between them is essentially metallic in character.
Their physical, chemical and mechanical properties are similar to those of
traditional materials, and generally superior to those of their crystalline
counterparts [1].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Amorphous materials can now be produced by several
techniques besides the rapid solidification of the metallic melts, a commonly
used method. The better known methods for amorphous alloy production are the
conventional wet electrodeposition process and other dry processes such as ion
sputtering, ion implantation, and laser glazing [2].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>One of the most widely used engineering coating is the
conventional chromium electrodeposition. It provides a high degree of wear
resistance, readily forms a protective oxide film and is esthetically pleasing.
Conventional chromium is commonly deposited from aqueous chromic acid baths
which contain from chromic oxide (CrO<sub>3</sub>) and sulfuric in a weight
ratio of 100:1. Typically chromium deposits contain a large number of
microcracks and pinholes. This will decrease corrosion resistance of the
deposits. Recently, many scholars have paid attention to preparation of
amorphous chromium deposits of chemically high homogeneity. Hoshino et al. [3]
included an organic additive with a -CHO or a -COOH group to a chromic acid
bath and attained amorphous chromium deposits. Tsai et al. [4] studied the
microstructures of electroplated amorphous chromium at various stages of
annealing temperature and found that the unusual hardness of the films was
related to the uniform distribution of submicron chromium dispersiods within
the carbon-rich matrix. Authors have studied the stability of the electrolyte
of amorphous chromium plating [5] and the mechanism of amorphous chromium
electrodeposition [6].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>Extremely high corrosion resistance which is difficult
to attain in crystalline alloy is one of the most important characteristics for
many amorphous alloys. The high corrosion resistance of amorphous alloys
provided by the formation of uniform passive film is attributed to chemically
high homogeneity as well as high passivating ability. Chromium is one of most
important anti-corrosive substances that constitute many kinds of commercial
stainless steel. Armstrong et al. [7] have already made attempts to apply a
rotating ring-disk electrode (rrde) technique to study the active and
transpassive dissolution of chromium in the acidic media. Okuyama et al. [8]
studied anodic dissolution of chromium in acidic sulfate solutions. They have
found that the passivation of chromium was attributable to the formation of the
trivalent chromium oxide such as CrO(OH). Zhang et al. [9] investigated the
corrosion resistance of the amorphous Cr-P alloys containing 0&#65374;5 at.% phosphorus prepared by arc-melting and demonstrated that the
amorphous Cr-P alloys had a significantly lower corrosion rate than that of
pure chromium. Stypula et al. [10] studied the characterization of passive
films on chromium oxides and/or hydroxides of Cr<sup>3+</sup>.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>In the present
work, the corrosion behavior of amorphous chromium deposit was examined in 1
mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 1 mol/L HCl solution with potentiodynamic
anodic polarization curves. The compositions of surface film of deposit after
anodic polarization were analyzed with XPS.</p>

<h3>Experimental procedure</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>The amorphous chromium films were electrodeposited
from the bath shown in Table 1 [5]. The electrolyte was prepared with double
distilled water and reagent grade chemicals. The anodes were two paralleled
Pb-5%Sb alloy plates situated vertically at the sides of the cell. The
substrate was a copper foil.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>The structure of the deposit was determined by x-ray
diffraction (XRD) with Cu K&#945; radiation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The copper foil substrates of as-deposited samples for TEM were removed by
dissolution with concentrated nitric acid. Afterwards the as-deposited samples
were electropolished in an electrolyte containing 210 ml/L H<sub>2</sub>O, 640
ml/L H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 150 ml/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>Prior to corrosion testing and polarization, nitrogen
was purged through the electrolyte approximately 10 min. A three-electrode cell
was used. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (25<sup>0</sup>C)
using a PARC Model 273 Potentiostat/Galvanostat and a microcomputer system
(IBM-AT), capable of controlling the experiments, collecting and plotting the
data. A couple of high density and unpermeable graphite electrodes and a
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter and reference
electrodes, respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization curves were measured by
sweep the potential anodically� at 1
mV/s after open circuit immersion for 10 min. Open circuit potentials were also
calculated for the results of polarization curves by M352 Corrosion Measurement
&amp; Analysis Software. All the potentials reported were relative to the SCE.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>After
potentiodynamic measurements were completed, the XPS was used for analysis of
the specimen surface film. X-ray photo-electron spectra (XPS) were measured
using MICROLABMK-II electron spectrometer with Mg K&#945;excitation
(hn
= 1253.6 eV). Binding energies of X-ray photo-electron spectra were calibrated
by the method described elsewhere [10]. The compositions of the surface film
were quantitatively determined from the XPS spectra by previously proposed
method [11].</p>

<h3>Results </h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>Chromium deposits were plated from the bath listed in
Table 1. Fig.1 and Fig. 2 show the results of X-ray diffraction and electron
diffraction pattern, respectively. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1 shows a broad
Gaussion peak at an angle of approximately 43<sup>0</sup>, and the electron
diffraction pattern in Fig. 2 exhibits a prominent diffuse ring and some
subsidiary fainter outer rings. The broad Gaussian peak in Fig. 1 and the halo
pattern in Fig. 2 suggest that the deposits may be considered amorphous in
structure. These results are in good agreement with those reported by Hoshoino
[3] and Tsai [4]. The reasons for amorphous structure of the deposits is due to
carbon codeposition [4]. Being a metalloid, carbon can aid the formation of an
amorphous structure during electrodeposition process.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Fig. 3 shows the changes in open circuit potential
with time for the amorphous chromium deposits and the conventional chromium
deposits in 1 mol/L HCl solution. The potential of the amorphous chromium
deposits initially decreases slightly with time, but reaches a constant value
of about -0.12V after a short period of about 200s, indicating the formation of
protective film. The open circuit potential of the conventional chromium
deposits is apparently lower than that of the amorphous chromium deposits.
Initially, the potential decreases sharply with time, and then decreases very
slowly between 50s to 400s, but after immersion time is more that 400s, the
potential decreases sharply.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>The anodic polarization curves of the electrodes which
were just measured the open circuit potential changes with time were measured
under the same conditions of above tests. Fig. 4 shows the anodic polarization
curve of amorphous chromium deposit in 1 mol/L HCl solution. The polarization curve
of the conventional chromium deposit is also shown for comparison. As seen from
Fig. 4, the conventional chromium deposit shows an active-passive transition,
although the passive current density is higher. Corrosion potential of the
conventional chromium deposit is located in the low potential region of about
-238mV. The corrosion potential of amorphous chromium deposit is -138mV in the
active region of conventional chromium deposit. It is clear that the amorphous
chromium deposit has a higher corrosion potential than conventional chromium
deposit. For amorphous chromium deposit, the active region almost disappears.
Accordingly the amorphous chromium deposit is spontaneously passive in 1 mol/L
HCl solution. Furthermore, the amorphous chromium deposit exhibits a lower
passive current density than that of the conventional chromium deposit.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>In order to compare the corrosion rates of two kinds
of deposits, Table 2 gives the results calculated from Fig. 4 by PARCalc
according to M352 software. Where i<sub>crit</sub> and i<sub>pass</sub> are the
current density at the active-passive transition and in the passive region,
respectively. E<sub>corr</sub> is the corrosion potential. The lower i<sub>crit</sub>
and i<sub>pass</sub>, the more easily passivated is the material. Non-passive
materials show a current, which increases monotonicaly with increasing
potential.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>It is seen from Table 2 that the amorphous chromium
deposit exhibits the corrosion rate two orders of magnitude lower than that of
the conventional chromium deposit. The conventional chromium deposit dissolved
actively showing a very high corrosion rate and the solution was turned to
green by Cr<sup>3+</sup>. Thus, it is considered that the amorphous chromium
deposit� possesses� a markedly higher corrosion resistance than
the conventional chromium deposit in 1 mol/L HCl solution due to spontaneous
passivation.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>It is generally believed that amorphous metals have
better corrosion resistance than polycrystalline metals. However, due to the
formation of a passivation film, conventional chromium deposit shows excellent
corrosion resistance, except toward hydrochloric acid. Fig 5 shows the changes
in open circuit potential with time for amorphous chromium deposit and
conventional chromium deposit in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution.
As has been found from Fig. 5, the open circuit potential of amorphous chromium
deposit is higher than that of conventional chromium deposit; the potential of
amorphous chromium deposit is almost independent of time and the potential of
conventional chromium deposit only appear to a slight decrease. These suggest
that amorphous chromium deposit and conventional chromium deposit all have
excellent corrosion resistance in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution
due to the presence of an air-formed oxide film, and amorphous chromium deposit
has stronger oxide film on the surface than conventional chromium deposit.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>Fig. 6 shows the potentiodynamic anodic polarization
curves for amorphous chromium deposit and conventional chromium deposit in 1
mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. Sweeping the potential in the
positive direction reveals the active-passive transition of chromium. Active
dissolution yields chromous ions while passivation results from the formation
of a blocking layer of &#65374;CrOOHiH<sub>2</sub>O [11]. The passive current is almost independent of potential
while the transpassive dissolution reaction becomes apparent as the potential
is increased beyond 1.0 V. This is associated with the production of chromate
ions, which color the solution yellow.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p>It can be seen from Fig. 6 that amorphous chromium
deposit and conventional chromium deposit�
can passivate spontaneously and only exhibits a little dissolution in 1
mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, and the former has a lower
passivation current. In order to investigated quantitatively corrosion
resistance of the deposits, Table 3 gives the results calculated from Fig. 6 by
M352 software. It is clearly shown that corrosion rate of amorphous chromium
deposit is 6 times lower than that of conventional chromium deposit, although
deposits of two kinds all exhibit a very low corrosion rate.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion resistance of chromium, in general, is
attributed to the formation of a passive film on the surface. Zhang et al. [9]
considered that the passive film consisted mainly of hydrated chromium
oxyhydroxide. As mentioned above, amorphous chromium deposit and conventional
chromium deposit all exhibit a excellent corrosion resistance, and the former
possesses a much lower corrosion rate than the latter. For a better
understanding of corrosion behavior of amorphous chromium deposit, XPS analysis
was performed. The specimens were potentiostatically polarized in 1 mol/L HCl
solution at 0.004 V for 1h and in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>solution
at 0.6 V for 1 h, respectively. The XPS spectrum of amorphous chromium deposit
has been shown that chromium, oxygen, chlorine, sulfate and carbon are present
in the near surface region. Carbon is incorporated into the layer from the
electrolytic bath during electrodeposition process. It has been known that the
amount of carbon is approximately 2&#65374;4 wt.% of the
general weight of amorphous chromium deposit [5, 6]. The C 1s spectrum showing
a peak at around 284.5 eV indicates that much of the carbon is of a graphic
form [3]. The O 1s spectrum consisted of two peaks at 530.4&#65374;531.0 and 531.6&#65374;532.2 eV, which were called OM and OH oxygen ,
respectively [5, 13]. The OM oxygen corrosponds to O<sup>2-</sup> ions in
oxyhydroxide and anhydrous oxide. The OH oxygen corressponds to OH<sup>-</sup>
ions and bound water in the surface film. The OM peak was substantially higher
than that of the OH peak in the entire O 1s spectrum. This indicates that the
surface film consists of oxyhydroxide in which the O<sup>2-</sup> content is
larger than the OH<sup>-</sup>content.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the XPS spectra of the chromium
2p peak in 1 mol/L HCl and 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions,
respectively. The Cr 2p<sub>3/2</sub> spectrum in Fig. 7 were complex, point to
a variety of electronic states of Cr in the surface region. The separate peaks
resolved during decomposition of the experimental spectra have been assigned
according to the data obtained in studies of simple chromium compounds and with
reference to other work [9, 11]. The Cr 2p<sub>3/2</sub> spectrum could be
easily decomposed to three peaks. The highest peak corresponding to the Cr (3+)
oxide phase, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, appeared at 576.4 eV. Another higher
peak corresponding to Cr (3+) hydroxide and its hydrated forms was at 577 eV.
The third peak corresponding to Cr<sup>0</sup> for metallic state was at 573.5
eV, but this peak is apparently lower than the first and second peaks. Therefore,
according to above analysis, it can be said that the surface film formed on
amorphous chromium deposit in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution is
composed of a mixture of chromium oxide and oxyhydroxide.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>The Cr 2p<sub>3/2</sub> spectrum in Fig. 8 consisted
of three almost equal intensity peak. They are Cr (3+) oxide phase at 576.6 eV,
Cr (3+) hydroxide at 577.3 eV and metallic state at 574.2 eV. These indicate
that the passive film formed on the surface of amorphous chromium deposit in 1
mol/L HCl solution is also composed of a mixture of chromium oxide and
oxyhydroxide. On the other hand, it can also be clearly seen that the intensity
of binding energy peak for metallic state chromium in 1 mol/L HCl solution is
apparently higher than in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. This
suggests that the passive film formed in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
solution is much stronger than in 1 mol/L HCl solution and amorphous chromium
deposit has a relatively high corrosion rate in 1 mol/L HCl solution than in 1
mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>In general, amorphous materials are chemically very
inert and this has sometimes been ascribed to their amorphous structure.; they
have no crystalline defects or interphase at grain boundaries, both of which
are vulnerable to localized attack in conventional alloys, Moreover, galvanic
effects associated with multiphase structures should be absent in amorphous
metals [14].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT><p>It has been well known that chromium possesses
excellent corrosion resistance due to the formation of the passive hydrated
chromium oxyhydroxide film. It can be seen from Table 2 and 3 that both
amorphous chromium deposit and conventional chromium deposit all display a good
corrosion resistance in 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, while in
1 mol/L HCl solution corrosion resistance of amorphous chromium deposit is
superior to conventional chromium deposit, although it can also dissolves
slowly. The XPS spectra analysis in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that the composition
of passive film on the surface of amorphous chromium deposit is similar to that
of conventional chromium deposit reported by others [9, 11]. They consist of
hydrated chromium oxyhydroxide. However, the corrosion resistance of deposits
of two kinds are apparently different. The amorphous chromium deposit is
remarkably superior to the conventional chromium deposit.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><p>Generally, it is considered that the corrosion
resistance of the material is associated with its composition and
microstructure. The high corrosion resistance of amorphous alloys provided by
the formation of uniform passive film is attributed to chemically high
homogeneity as well as high passivating ability [9]. It has been confirmed that
the existence of a chemically heterogeneous crystalline phase results in a
deterioration in the corrosion resistance of the amorphous Fe-base alloys [15].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p>Conventional chromium deposit normally assumes a
body-centered cubic crystal structure [16]. It has many defects which may be
described as pinhole and crack defects. Owing to existence of these defects,
conventional chromium deposit cannot effectively prevent the substrate from
corrosion. Moreover, although conventional chromium deposit reveals a good
corrosion resistance in a less aggressive environment (e.g., 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
due to its air-formed oxide film (Fig. 6 and Table 3), it occurs pitting
corrosion in acidic solutions containing chloride, and thus resulting in
decrease of corrosion resistance. However, amorphous materials possess
outstanding resistance to pitting corrosion. For example, amorphous
Fe-25Cr-xMo-28B does not pit on anodic polarization in 6 mol/L HCl at room
temperature when x &gt; 5 [15]. It is generally held that amorphous materials
are relatively immune to pitting corrosion by comparison with steels of similar
to composition in similar media because their passive films are highly uniform
and less porous than those formed on steel [15]. It can be seen from Fig. 4 and
Fig. 6 that amorphous chromium deposit exhibits an excellent corrosion
resistance whether in aggressive media (e.g., 1 mol/L HCl) or in less
aggressive media (e.g., 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) due to its
homogeneity in structure and composition.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p>Amorphous chromium deposit has been prepared by
electrodeposition technology from solution containing hexavalent chromium ions.
It is clear that the film does not contain the pinhole and crack defects which
are seen in conventional chromium deposit. It is homogeneity in structure and
composition. Therefore, it possesses significantly more excellent corrosion
resistance in comparison with conventional chromium deposit in acidic media,
particularly in acidic solutions containing chloride. Amorphous chromium
deposit is spontaneously passivated in 1 mol/L HCl and 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
solutions. The passive film formed on the amorphous chromium deposit is similar
to that on the conventional chromium deposit and mainly consists of chromium
oxyhydroxide. Moreover, the passive chromium oxyhydroxide film is more
protective, stable and resistant in comparison with that conventional chromium
deposit.</p>
