<SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><p>The inhibition of corrosion of mild steel in HCl solution by [4 � amino �2 methyl �5 � pyrimidinyl
methyl thio ] acetic acid (AMMPTA), 3-[4 � amino �2 methyl � 5 � pyrimidyl
methyl ] �5- [2 � hydroxyethyl]-4-methylthiazoliumchloride
hydrochloride (AMMPTC) or Thiamine
chloride (Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) and thioglycollic acid (TGA) has been studied.�� Weight loss and hydrogen evolution measurements reveal that
AMMPTA exhibits a higher maximum inhibition�
efficiency than� AMMPTC and TGA.
Generally, inhibition was found� to
increase� with increase in
inhibitor� concentration,� half-life, activation energy and decrease in
the first-order rate constants at 30 and 40<sup>o</sup>C. Physical
adsorption� mechanism� has been proposed� for the inhibitors and the�
difference in the inhibition behaviour of the compounds has been
explained on the� basis of molecular
weights and molecular structures.</p>

<h3 align=left><b>Introduction</b></h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Corrosion of metals is a major industrial problem that has attracted
a lot of investigators in recent years [1-3]. Corrosion inhibitors are of
great� practical importance, being
extensively employed� in minimizing� metallic waste in engineering� materials�
[2].�� Several� N � and S � containing organic compounds
have been� used as inhibitors
[3-5].� The corrosion� inhibition is a surface process which
involves the� adsorption of the� organic�
compounds on metal surface [4,5]. The inhibition efficiency of organic
compounds depends on molecular size, mode of�
interaction� with the metal
surface [3-5]. The adsorption depends mainly on the electronic structure of
the molecules. [4 � amino � 2 � methyl �5 � pyrimidinyl methyl thio] acetic
acid� (AMMPTA) and 3 � [4 � amino � 2 �
methyl � 5 � pyrimidyl methyl] � 5 � [2 -�
hydroxyethyl] � 4- methyl thiazolium chloride hydrochloride (AMMPTC) or
Thiamine Chloride (Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>) are potential corrosion �inhibitors, since these compounds� contain nitrogen�
and sulphur� [6-8].
However, studies on use of chelating agents as inhibitors� especially those bearing nitrogen� and�
sulphur as coordinating� atoms,
are few� in the� literature. AMMPTA is unique� since�
it contains a wide� variety of
coordination sites,� namely, the
heterocyclic nitrogen, the amino group, the carboxyl group and sulphur� donor atom, in addition to being amphoteric
[ 6,8 ] </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>AMMPTC� (Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>)
consists of a pyrimidine ring and a� thiazollium
ring bridged by methylene� group is
already known for� its versatility
in� complex formation owing to its
varied coordination� sites [ 7 ].� AMMPTC��
and their derivatives� have
opened a wide field� of study in
coordination� and bioinorganic� chemistry [ 8,13 ]. Thioglycollic&nbsp; acid (TGA) has a wide range of application,� being used in prevention of corrosion
of copper, in the cosmetics and oil industries [ 9,10,13 ]. The aim�
of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of� molecular size, changing functional and
structural� groups on the
protection� efficiency imparted� by the molecules. In this investigation,
weight loss and hydrogen� evolution
techniques were used� to study corrosion
of mild steel in HCl� solutions containing AMMPTA, AMMPTC and TGA. The
inhibitor efficiency at each concentration�
of inhibitor used was calculated using the equation ( 1 ) </p>

<h3><b>Experimental</b></h3>

<h4>Material� Preparation</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>Every sheet was 0.04cm� in thickness and 97.8% purity were machined
into coupons of dimension�5.0x 4.0cm, and�
3.0 x 2.0cm. A 0.015cm� diameter
hole were drilled on the centre� of the
shorter sides of all the coupons for�
suspension. These� coupons were used as supplied without
further polishing, but were�degreased
in absolute ethanol and dried� in
acetone. The coupons were stored� in a
desiccator in the� absence of moisture
before their use for the� investigation.
[4- amino � 2- methyl �5 � pyrimidinyl methyl thio] acetic acid (AMMPTA)
was� prepared from 3-[ 4 - amino �2 �
methyl � 5 � pyrimidyl� methyl ] � 5 -�� [2- hydroxyethyl ] � 4 � methylthiazolium
(AMMPTC)� and thioglycollic acid [TGA]
according to the method of Bonvicinol and Hennessy [18]. AMMPTA was
recrystalized� twice from hot� water and dried in an oven. The inhibitor
concentrations of 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>, 1x 10 <sup>� 5 </sup>�, 1x 10<sup>-4</sup>, 5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> and
1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M were prepared� in
0.5 M HCl solution at 30 and 40&deg;C. The�� prepared inhibitor solutions were used� for all measurements. All reagents were of analar grade and
doubly distilled� water was used for the
preparations of all solutions.</p>

<h4>Weight Loss Determination �</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>Mild steel coupons of 4.0 x 5.0 x 0.04 cm were used for weight loss
measurements. The total geometric surface area of coupons exposed is 40.0cm<sup>2</sup>,
and the average weight is 7.11 to 7.14 grams. The coupons were suspended
through a hole 0.015cm in diameter. Five 250ml beakers, which separately contained
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5M HCl solutions, were maintained at 30 and
then 40&deg;C, constituting first set of experiment(s). Previously
weighed mild steel coupons were each suspended in each beaker through a 0.015
cm� in diameter hole. The coupons of this first
set of experiments were retrieved from their corrodent at 24 hours� interval progressively for 168 hours (7
days). They were then chemically cleaned in 20% sodium hydroxide containing
200gl<sup>-1</sup> of zinc dust in order to remove the corrosion product. After
rinsing in distilled water and absolute ethanol, the coupons were dried and
weighed. The weight loss was calculated in grams as the difference between the
initial weight prior to immersion, and weight after removal of the corrosion
product. Each reading reported is an average of two readings recorded to the
nearest 0.0001g on a Mettler AE 166 (Delta range) analytical balance.
Experiments were repeated with the introduction of five different concentration
(1x10<sup>-6</sup>M to 1x10<sup>-3</sup>M) of AMMPTA, AMMPTC and TGA in 0.5M
HCl solution at 30 and 40 <sup>0</sup>C. Fifteen 250ml beakers which separately
contained 1x10<sup>-6</sup>, 1x10<sup>-5</sup>, 1x10<sup>-4</sup>, 5 x <sup>10-4
</sup>and 1x10<sup>-3</sup>M of inhibitor concentrations were maintained at 30and then 40&deg;C. Previously weighed coupons were then placed in
the corrodent inhibitor solutions containing one mild steel coupon. As before,
each coupon was retrieved from the solution at 24 hours intervals,
progressively for 168 hours (7 days). The difference in weight of the coupons
was again taken as the weight loss. </p>

<h4> Hydrogen evolution technique</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>The gasometric assembly for the measurement of hydrogen
evolution from the corrosion of mild steel was designed following the� method employed by Onuchukwu et al [11] and
Ekpe et al [3]. Mild steel coupons of 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.04 cm were used in the
experiments. The two faces had 12.0cm<sup>2</sup> total geometric surface area
and the average weight is 2.30 to 2.34 grams. The volume of the HCl used in
each experiment is 100ml. A 100ml solution of 8M HCl was introduced into the
reaction vessel connected to a burrete through a delivery tube. The initial
volume of air in the burrette was recorded. One mild steel coupon was dropped
into 8M HCl solution and the reaction vessel quickly closed. Variation in the
volume of hydrogen evolved with time was recorded every I minutes for 30
minutes. Each experiment was conducted on a fresh specimen of mild steel
coupon. The hydrogen evolved displaces the fluid in the gasometric set-up,
which is read directly (cm<sup>3</sup>). The same experiment was repeated in
the presence of the inhibitors having the concentration of 1 x 10<sup>-6 </sup>M
to 1x10<sup>-3</sup> M as used in the weight loss determinations but with a
corrodent concentration of 8M� HCl
solution.</p>

<h3><b>Results and discussion</b></h3>

<h4>Effect of corrodent concentration</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p align="center"><img border="0" src="FIG1.gif" width="360" height="354"></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p><b>Figure 1 Variation of corrosion rate (mg dm<sub>-2 </sub>per day) with
corrodent concentration for mild steel
coupons in HCl solutions at 30&deg;C without inhibitor</b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 1 shows the variation
of corrosion rate with corrodent concentration at 30&deg;C. It is
observed that the corrosion rate (mg dm<sup>-2</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>) of mild
steel increases with increased concentration of HCl. This observation is in
agreement with several investigators [3,5] and may be due to increasing
concentration of an ion active in corrosion reaction [12]. From figure 2 a
linear variation is observed for the plot of logarithm of weight loss against
time. This confirms a first order reaction kinetics with respect to the mild
steel in HCl solution</p>

<h4>Effect of inhibitor concentration on inhibition efficiency</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 3 shows the variation of inhibition efficiency
with various compounds investigated (AMMPTA, AMMPTC and TGA) Generally,
inhibition efficiency of the compounds is in this order AMMPTA &gt; AMMPTC&gt;
TGA at all temperatures studied. This trend of inhibition effectiveness is also
confirmed from the hydrogen evolution measurements (figure 4) studied at very
high corrodent concentration (8M HCl). At 8M HCl solution, the effect of
dissolution could exceed that of adsorption of the inhibitors on the mild steel
due to high chloride ion concentration, thereby resulting in a reduction in
inhibition efficiency when compared with 0.5M HCl for AMMPTA and AMMPTC.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Application of the principles of chemical kinetics to the results</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p>Tables 1-3 give the kinetic data obtained in the presence of AMMPTA,
AMMPTC and TGA� respectively. The rate
constants at 30&deg;C  (K<sub>30</sub>) and 40&deg;C 
(K<sub>40</sub>)
were used to calculate the activation energy of the system using the integrated
form of the Arrhenius equation, i.e</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p>From tables 1-3, the rate constants at 30&deg;C (K<sub>30</sub>), 40&deg;C (K<sub>40</sub>) show a general decrease with increased
inhibitor concentration, inhibition efficiency, half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) and
activation energy of the metal - corrodent - inhibitor systems. Similar trend
in kinetic data has been reported by several investigators [3,5,12] and� indicates that a good inhibitor is one that
is able to increase the time of conversion of metals to corrosion products. The
half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of the mild steel obtained in the absence of the
inhibitors in� 0.5 M HCl is 47.7 day at
30&deg;C and 32.2 day at 40&deg;C respectively. The rate
constant. K<sub>30</sub> and K<sub>40</sub>without inhibitor are 0.0145 and
0.0214� day<sup>-1 </sup>�respectively while 30.7 kJmol<sup>-1 </sup>is
obtained as the average activation energy of the metal - corrodent system
without inhibitor at 30&deg;C<sup> </sup>and
40&deg;C in 0.5M HCl solution. Tables 1-3 show increase in half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>)
when inhibitors are present, which further support the� assertion that the compounds are corrosion
inhibitors for mild steel in HCl solution.</p>

<h4>Comparison of corrosion inhibition behaviour of the inhibitors</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p>From� figure 3
and 4 and tables 1-3 AMMPTA exhibits a better corrosion inhibition tendency
than AMMPTC and TGA. The structures of the compounds are given in figures 5 to
8 as in the literatures [6-8 ]. The highest inhibition efficiencies were
exhibited by AMMPTA. These are 86 and 70% from weight loss and hydrogen
evolution measurements respectively. AMMPTC exhibit 78 and 66% respectively
while TGA exhibit� 59 and 50% from
weight loss and hydrogen evolution measurements respectively, were obtained at
1x10<sup>-3</sup> M inhibitor concentration at 30&deg;C.�
At 40&deg;C low values of inhibition
efficiencies are recorded for all the inhibitors� signifying that the compounds are all physically adsorbed on the
mild steel coupons for the inhibition to be effective. The average activation
energy values of the inhibitors reported as 73.9 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for AMMPTA,
61.5 kJmol<sup>-1</sup> for AMMPTC and 46.6 kJmol <sup>-1</sup> for TGA confirm
the assertion that the inhibition of the corrosion of mild steel is by physical
adsorption mechanism. This observation is in good agreement with several
investigators [3,5 ]. These reports state that the heat of chemical adsorption
should be greater than 80 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and less than this value
signifies a physical adsorption mechanism. Also, for a chemical adsorption
mechanism, inhibition efficiency increases with increase in temperature [12 ],
whereas increase in inhibition efficiency with decrease in temperature is
suggestive of a physical adsorption mechanism (tables 1-3 and fig. 3). Since we
have proposed physical adsorption mechanism for the present inhibitors, a multi
- layer protective coverage is expected on the entire mild steel surface by the
inhibitors for the inhibition to be effective. However, we observe that AMMPTC
with a higher molecular weight (337 gm) than AMMPTA (214 gm) is less effective
than AMMPTA. The difference in the inhibitory actions of AMMPTA and AMMPTC
could be explained in terms of the ability of AMMPTA to form chelate structure
with metal ion wherein four co-ordinate bonds are involved, fig. 9 as reported
by Adeyeno et al� [6,8,13 ]</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p>Although we have
proposed a physical adsorption mechanism for the present inhibitors, this may
not rule out completely the contributory effect of the structure (cyclic
structure versus� linear structure,
electron donating or with drawing groups, geometric factors and inhibitor
solubility, which in the present investigation play a very less significant
role and is not considered sufficiently important for the purposes of our
discursion. However, the effect of the structure could have been of interest in
the case of chemical adsorption mechanism where there is usually a dative link
between the inhibitor and the metal [3,12 ]</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT><p align="center"><b>Figure 7��� Thioglycollic
acid�� (TGA)</b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(35)</SCRIPT><p>The difference in
the inhibition actions of AMMPTA and AMMPTC could be explained by the
comparison of their coordination sites. The comparison of the donor properties
of AMMPTA is more straight forward than in the parent AMMPTC (Thiamine)
-molecule� where the pyrimidine ring is
conjugated with the thiazolium ring [8 ]. The aromatic nature of the
pyrimidinyl moiety of AMMPTA, tends to make the 2 - 4-, and 6- positions
naturally electron - deficient by virtue of the powerful electron with drawing
effect of the ring nitrogen atom of the pyrimidyl ring which are metal to each
other. Their separate effects reinforce each other and the resultant effect is
the withdraw of the lone pair of the electrons on the substituent amino group
at 4 - position of the pyrimidyl ring which in effect leads to electron
deficiency and positively charged metal ion will prefer the 5-position of the
thioacetic and substituent site to the ring nitrogen and the amino group� figure 5��
[8,13 ]. And the lone pair of electrons on both the sulfur� and the carboxyl groups provide a good site
of coordination at the high pH and in acidic medium. </p>

<h3 align=left><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(36)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion of mild steel in HCl
solution without inhibitor increases with increase in acid concentration and
temperature. The inhibitors used in this investigation (AMMPTA, AMMPTC and TGA)
inhibit the acid corrosion of mild steel to various degrees. The order of
inhibition efficiency (%) is AMMPTA &gt; AMMPTC &gt; TGA. On the basis of� activation energy, AMMPTA and its precursor
obey the mechanism of physical adsorption. The inhibition efficiency increases
with increasing inhibitor concentration and decreasing temperature.</p>
