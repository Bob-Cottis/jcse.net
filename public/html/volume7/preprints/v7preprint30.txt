Abstract The influence of some hydrazide derivatives as corrosion inhibitors for zinc in 2M sodium hydroxide solution has been studied using weight loss and galvanostatic polarization techniques. In general, at consant acid concentration, inhibitor efficiency increases with increase of concentration of inhibitor and decrease with rise in temperature. Polarization studies revealed that these compounds behave as mixed inhibitors. The effect of temperature on corrosion inhibition has been studied and activation energies has been calculated. Some thermodynamic parameters are calculated and discussed. The adsorption of the inhibitors on zinc surface is found to obey Temkin's adsorption isotherm.. Addition of Ca+2 , Sr+2 ,Ba+2 and Mg+2 ions to the alkaline medium containing the hydrazide derivatives increases the inhibition efficiency of the system. Key words: corrosion, zinc, sodium hydroxide, hydrazide derivatives. 1.Introduction Because of the wide spread use of zinc, the study of its corrosion has turned to be an out standing subject in corrosion with the industry today. For these reasons, considerable efforts have been devoted to study the electrochemical behaviour of zinc in alkaline media. A general survey of the literature indicates that the nature and mechanism of the zinc passivation in alkaline solutions is the subject of debate. Various mechanisms involing several intermediate species have been proposed for passivation of Zn in alkaline solutions(1-11) . In some works, Zn (OH)2 has been proposed to be passivating species(6,10). For other authors it is ZnO(3,12), Moreover, in certain cases, the passive film has been supposed to consist of a dual layer, composed of ZnO and Zn (OH)2 or of two types of Zno (3, 6 , 12 , 13). The oxide growth on the zinc electrode under prevailing experimental conditions could be explained on the basis of the following reactions (14,15): Zn+ OH - = Zn (OH)ads + e Zn (OH)-ads + 2OH- = Zn (OH)-3 + e (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)

The average thickness of the passive layer formed on Zn electrode in alkaline solution changes according to the operating conditions and reaches about 50nm (10, 16) .Recently, it was found that the rate of oxide growth in the passive region increases with decreasing

Fig 1. shows the effect of the period of immersion on the corrosion of zinc in presence and absence of different concentrations of compound (b) in alkali media. The curves are characterized by an initial slow rise in weight- loss followed by a sharp rise. The curves obtained in the presence of additives fall below that of alkali. The weight loss of zinc depends upon the type and the concentration of the additives. The inhibition efficiency (%I) of various inhibitors, decreases in the order (Table 1): Compound (b) > compound (c) > compound (a) 3.2. Synergistic effect: Effect of the addition of 0.02% Ca+2 , Sr+2 ,Ba+2 ,Mg+2 ions to different concentrations of additives on the corrosion inhibition of Zn in 2M NaOH using weight less technique was studied. the percentage inhibition efficiency brought about by 0.02% of these cations. From the results obtained it was found that Ba2+ > Sr2+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ . This has a qualitative correspondence the inereasing atomic weight of these cations and it may be explained on the basis of their basicity which increase by increasing atomic weights.

It is also observed from Tables (2-5) that the inhibition efficiency of the inhibitors increases in the presence of Ca+2 , Sr+2,Ba+2 and Mg+2 .This may be due to the fact that these cations are chemisorbed on the zinc surface and aids in bringing negatively charged species inclusive of the zincate ion closer to the metal surface, thus enhancing inhibition efficiency as has actually been observed. The synergistic parameter ,s was calculated using equation (11). The plots of the , synergism parameter (s  (in case of BaCl 2) against various concentrations of inhibitors is ) ginven in Fig (2), and corresponding values are show in Table (6)

Since most of these values of s are about unity (similar results were obtained in case of SrCl 2 , CaCl2 and MgCl 2 and are not shown), the higher inhibition efficiency of cation and additives can be calculated as brought out by synergistic effect. 3.3.Adsorption isotherm.

The plotting log  (1-  against log C at / ) 300 C is given in Fig (4), where straight line relationships were obrained suggesting the validity of this model for all cases studied. The calculated values of 1/y , K and Gads are given in Table (7) . Inspection of the data of this Table shows that the large values of  ads and its negative G sign, indicate that the adsorption of hydrazide compounds on the zinc surface is proceeding spontaneousty and is acompained by a highly- efficient adsorption. It is worth noting that the value of 1/y is more than unity. This means that the given inhibitor molecules will occupy more than one active sites. In general, the values of A Gads obtained from El- Awady et al model are comparable with those obtained from Temkin isotherm.

The almost similar values of Ea suggest that the inhibitors are similar in the mechanism action and the order of the efficiency many be related to the preexponential factor A in equation (15). This is further related to concentration, steric effects, metal surfac characters. The relationship between log k/T vs. 1/T gives stlaight line (Fig.7), from its slope,  H* can be calculated and from its intercept S* can be also calculated .

An increase in the concentration, of inhibitor shifted the polarization curves towards more negative potentials for cathodic Tafel lines, and towards more positive potentials for anodic Tafel lines. Polarization data suggested that the additives used act as mixed-type inhibitors ( = ). The corrosion kinetic parameters such as corrosion current a C density ( Icorr.), corrosion potential (Ecorr) , cathodic Tafel slope (), anodic Tafel lines (), C a degree of surface coverage ( and percentage inhibition(%I) were derived from the curves ) Fig. 8 are recorded in Table (10) .

The order of decreasing inhibition efficiency of the investigated hydrazide derivatives in 2M NaOH is : compound (b) > compound (c) > compound (a) The inhibition efficiency of the compounds depends on many factors (19) , which include the number of adsorption active centers in the molecule and their charge density, molecular size, mode of a desorption, heat of hydrogenation and formation of metallic complexes.

The obtained results of the additives (Table 1 ) indicate that: Compound (b) exhibits excellent inhibition power due to:(i) its larger molecular size that may facilitate better surface coverage, (ii) its adsorption through three active centers as shown from Fig (9),and (iii) the presence of p-CH3 (=-0.17) which is highly electron releasing group which enhance the delocalized  -electrons on the active centers of the compound. Compound (c) comes after compound (b) in inhibition efficiency inspite of it has three active centers, because it has lesser molecular size and has no substituent in p-position (Hatom with  =0.0) which contributes no charge density to the molecule . Compound (a) has the lowest inhibition efficiency,in spite of it has three active centers.this is because it has the lowest molecular size and the aromatic ring in compound (c) covers more surface area than the aliphatic ones in compound (a). 4.Conclusion 1- All the additives are found to perform well as a corrosion inhibitors in sodium hydroxide solution and the inhibiting efficiency values of the examined compounds follow the order: compound (b) > compound (c) > compound (a) at all the studied concentrations. 2-The compounds studied are found to act as mixed-type inhibitors, 3- the protection efficiency increases with a decrease in temperature or an increase in the concentration of the studied compounds . 4- The adsorption of" these compounds was found to follow Temkin's adsorption isotherm. 5- The addition of Ba 2+, Ca 2+, Sr2+, Mg2+ , was found to increase the percentage inhibition due to synergistic effect.
