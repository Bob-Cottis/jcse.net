Abstract The inhibiting effect of N-Cyclohexylbenzothiazolsulphen-amida (NCBSA) on the corrosion of carbon steel in a solution of NH4Cl 10 -1M (pH = 5,5) at temperatures of 25º C, 35º C, 45º C and 55º C has been studied by using weight loss measurements and electrochemical measurements. The morphology of carbon-steel surface in the absence and in the presence of NCBSA was examined under the microscope. The activation energy (Ea ) was determined from Arrhenius equation. The activation enthalpy ( Hº) and the activation entropy ( were calculated from the diagram of the critical Sº) complex. The experimental data characterize an adsorption isotherm of type Langmuir.

have been proposed in order to improve

anti-corrosion protection. The efficiency of the corrosion inhibition by organic compounds is closely related to the structure and properties of the film formed on the metal surface. For the carbon-steel corrosion inhibition in different mediums, there have been used organic compounds that contain sulphur and nitrogen, the results showing that several inhibitors act through adsorption on the metal surface

. It has been

observed that the adsorption depends especially on the electronic structure of the molecule and that the inhibiting effect increases with the increase in the number of the aromatic nuclei. The adsorption process is also influenced by the metal nature and surface, by the electrolyte nature and the interactions between the organic molecules and the metal surface, and by temperature 20 -33. The action mechanisms of the organic inhibitors as well as the factors influencing the adsorption depend on the strength of the bond inhibitor-metal 34-39. The present study aims to determine the role of NCBSA in improving the protective film in case of generalized corrosion of carbon steel in a low acid medium (pH = 5,5) that contains NH4Cl 10-1M, by determining the parameters of activation of the dissolving reaction and the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface.

using the gravimetric method. The utilized carbon steel has the following composition: C=0,1%, Si=0,035%, Mn=0,4%, Cr=0,3%, Ni=0,3% and the rest up to 100% Fe. For the gravimetrical determinations, the metal samples with a surface of 4 cm2 were mechanically polished with sand-paper of different sizes, decapped with a solution of 5% HCl, washed in double distilled water, degreased in ethylic alcohol and dried in warm air. To avoid the change of the solution concentration on through water evaporation, the experiments were effected in a closed system. The corrosion rates of carbon steel were determined in a solution of NH4Cl 10-1M in the absence and presence of some variable concentrations of NCBSA: 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm and respectively, 1,89.10-4M, 3,78. 10-4M, 5,68.10-4M, 7,56.10-4M. The immersion time of the plates in the respective media were 3 hours at temperatures of 25º C, 35º C, 45º C and 55º C. Before being introduced in corrosive media, the plates were exactely weighed on analytical scales. The corrosion products were removed once the samples were taken out of the corrosive mediums, by washing them in a warm solution of HCl 5%, after which they were degreased in ethilic alcohol, dried in warm air and weighed again on the analytical scales. The mass variation is conditioned by the composition; the nature of medium and work temperature Electrochemical measurements For the study of polarization a standard corrosion cell was used, with a working electrode made of carbon-steel with an active surface of 4 cm2 . The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. The auxiliary electrode was a carbon-steel plate identical to the one used as the working electrode. The carbon steel

electrodes were made of the same material as the plates used for weight loss measurements. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2420 3A Source Meter, and the data were computerized. The morphology of steel's surface before and after being treated with NCBSA was examined with a STEM LEO 911 OMEGA microscope Results and discussion Weight loss measurements For the carbon steel samples the weight losses were determined in a solution of NH4Cl 10-1M, in the absence and presence of several variable concentrations of NCBSA: 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm at different temperatures: 25º C, 35º C, 45º C, 55º C.

where:  = mass loss due to corrosion (g), S = the corroded surface (m2), t = action G time for corrosive processes. The variation of the corrosion rate with the concentration of NCBSA at different temperatures is presented in Figure 1. The increase in concentration of NCBSA leads to a decrease in the corrosion rate. This suggests that the inhibition of carbon steel corrosion in the presence of NCBSA is due to the adsorption of the latter on the metal surface. On the other hand, an increase in temperature from 25º C to 50º C leads to an increase in the corrosion rate,

metallic cations that are found in the steel composition. These complexes can form permanent stable films on the steel surface, thus decreasing the corrosion rate. The good adsorbability of NCBSA can be related to the basicity of the thiazolic nucleus and to the pair of non-participant electrons from the sulphur atom in the thiazolic cycle.

It can be also presupposed that the adsorbability of the NCBSA molecules around the corrosion spots in incipient stages (initiation and propagation) is due to the non-participant electrons from the sulphur atom and nitrogen from the lateral chain of the thiazolic cycle, or that this chain contributes to the increase in the thickness of the adsorption layer. It can be said that a competitive adsorption takes place between the inhibitor molecules and the Cl- anion on the steel surface.

Five determinations were made for each solution, taking into consideration the most reproducible responses for the same current densities. In this study, the minimum recorded current was 10µA. Thus Ecor was defined as the potential from which a current larger than 10µA was observed. The anodic polarization of steel electrodes in the inhibitor containing NH4Cl 10-1M is shifted to less negative values, while the cathodic polarization shifts to more negative values with increasing current density. The presence of organic inhibitors in the corrosive medium increases the anodic and cathodic overpotentials and decreases the corrosion current (icor). These changes increase with increasing inhibitor concentration. This behaviour supports the inhibition function of these organic compounds. Decrease of the corrosion current (icor) was associated with an appreciable

shift of corrosion potential (Ecor) to a less negative value. This suggests that although inhibition is of mixed type, it is predominantly anodic. The percentage inhibition efficiency (P) of these inhibitors was also determined from the polarization measurements according to the equation: i'  i P  cor ' cor  100 i cor (8)

where i'cor and i cor are the uninhibited and inhibited corrosion current density, respectively, obtained by extrapolation of the anodic and cathodic Tafel lines to the corrosion potential. In the presence of the inhibitor, the steel is active and dissolves by a Tafel slope of 85 ± 5 mV. The cathodic process is determined by the cathodic reduction of all the components, namely, O2, NH4+ . The reduction of water molecules is probably an additional cathodic process. Metal ionization is suppressed by the inhibitor more strongly (Figure 7) than the cathodic process is stimulated, and the free corrosion potential of steel becomes significantly higher with an increase in C-NCBSA The results are presented in table 3.

It can be observed that the inhibition efficiency calculated from the weight loss measurements is close to that calculated from electrochemical measurements, especially at high concentrations of inhibitor. The surface analysis of the corroded samples was effected under a microscope STEM LEO 912 omega. In the absence of the inhibitor (Figure 8.1) the experiments show that the surface was covered with a great number of corrosion spots. In the presence of NCBSA the corrosion spots decrease in intensity at the same time with the increase in inhibitor concentration 200 ppm (Figure 8.2). This demonstrates that the metal surface is covered by a superficial layer that offers it a good protection.

Conclusions NCBSA is an inhibitor for the corrosion of carbon steel in a solution of NH4Cl 10-1M at a concentration of 200 ppm (7,56.10-4M) in the corrosive medium it has an efficiency of 81% obtained by weight loss measurements respectively 83.6% by electrochemical measurements. NCBSA acts through adsorption on the metal surface. On studying the inhibitor it has been found that the experimental data observe the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.  ads is negative, which shows that the adsorption Gº process of NCBSA on the metal surface is spontaneous.
