</b>
<p>This paper describes a new experiment for studying crevice corrosion. A wire
beam electrode was employed in this experiment to measure electrochemical
parameters directly from crevice area and these parameters were used to
calculate instantaneous crevice corrosion kinetics. A clear correlation between
calculated corrosion depth map and real corrosion appearance was obtained.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Crevice corrosion often occurs in fissure or occluded region where the local
solution is stagnant and is isolated from the bulk solution. Although crevice
corrosion has been studied extensively and been modelled mathematically over the
past decades, some aspects of crevice corrosion remain unclear and the
completeness and accuracy of the proposed crevice corrosion mechanisms and
models are often not experimentally verified. This situation may largely be due
to technical difficulties associated with conventional crevice corrosion
experiments.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Crevice corrosion is a heterogeneous electrochemical process in nature. When
crevice corrosion occurs, there is a distinct separation of the anodic and
cathodic regions on the metal surface and different electrochemical reactions
occur on the anodic and cathodic areas. Electrons continuously travel from the
anode areas to the cathode areas through the electrode body and at the same time
ions travel between anode and cathode areas through the electrolyte, resulting
in rapid corrosion penetration on crevice areas. To characterise a crevice
corrosion process, electrochemical parameters at local areas of a working
electrode surface such as local anodic reaction current, have to be determined.
However, conventional electrochemical techniques have major difficulties in
doing this. This is mainly because conventional electrochemical techniques use a
one-piece electrode, an electrode which is constructed by a single piece of
metal or other electrically conductive material of a chosen size. When such a
one-piece electrode is used, normally only mixed and averaged electrochemical
parameters, for instance a mixed potential, over the whole electrode surface are
measurable. These measured electrochemical parameters are neither related
specifically to the anodic zone nor the cathodic zone of the heterogeneous
electrode surface. Again, with a one-piece electrode, it is impossible to
measure the galvanic currents that flow in the electrode body between localised
anodic and cathodic sites since an ammeter is not able to be inserted between
anodic and cathodic sites which are located on a single piece of metal surface.
Furthermore, conventional electrochemical techniques have limitations in
determining the kinetics of heterogeneous electrode processes. The fundamental
formulation describing the electrochemical kinetics over a metal surface, the
Butler-Volmer equation, is based on a uniform electrochemical mechanism.
Traditional electrochemical techniques which are based on the Butler-Volmer
equation such as the Tafel polarisation method, the linear polarisation method
and the AC impedance spectroscopy, in principle, are applicable only to measure
the electrochemical kinetics of a uniform electrode surface.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>To overcome some of the difficulties associated with conventional
electrochemical methods. A multi-piece electrode, namely the wire beam electrode
(WBE), has been developed [1-8]. The WBE is fabricated from a metallic wire
bundle embedded in insulating materials. The metal wire bundle is constructed
from many electrically insulated metal wire sensors which are made from metal
wires of identical, dissimilar, galvanised, heat-treated or stressed metal
materials with the terminals of the wire bundle connected together. The WBE can
be variously designed to meet different industrial and research requirements.
Its surface shape normally simulates the surface shape of a practical
work-piece. A schematic diagram showing the conceptual design of the WBE and its
application in crevice corrosion testing is in Figure 1.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>The WBE was initially developed and used to detect local defects in organic
coating films [1-4]. Its application has been extended to the study of localised
corrosion phenomena [3-9] and the study of various heterogeneous electrochemical
processes such as cathodic protection processes [3, 7]. The WBE has several
characteristics which make it uniquely suitable for studying localised corrosion
and other heterogeneous electrochemical processes. Firstly, each wire in a WBE
is an individual addressable electrochemical sensor. This enables a WBE to
measure electrochemical parameters from local areas of an integrated electrode
surface by means of wires located at those areas. Secondly, the working surface
of a WBE, integrated by connecting all wire terminals, can effectively simulate
the electrochemical corrosion processes occurring on a conventional one piece
electrode surface [6, 7, 9]. Similar corrosion patterns were experimentally
observed over a WBE and a large area one piece electrode surface when both
electrodes were exposed to an identical environment designed to cause localised
corrosion [6, 7] and this experimental result has been explained [6]. Thirdly,
the surface area of each wire in an WBE is much smaller than the total working
electrode area, thus corrosion and electrochemical processes on each wire
surface can be assumed to be uniform even if the whole electrode surface is
electrochemically nonuniform [6]. This approach is an analogy to calculus
principles. This assumption allows electrochemical techniques and theories of
describing uniform electrochemical processes to be applied to each wire in an
integrated WBE, i.e. traditional electrochemical theories and techniques are
extended to study localised corrosion and other heterogeneous electrochemical
processes. Based on this assumption and the Butler-Volmer equation, new
equations describing the electrochemical kinetics of each individual wire have
been derived [6] and applied to study the kinetics of localised corrosion
processes [6, 8, 9].</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>This paper describes a simple crevice corrosion experiment. A wire beam
electrode was employed in this experiment as a key tool to measure
electrochemical parameters directly from crevice area and these parameters were
used to calculate instantaneous crevice corrosion kinetics. Some preliminary
experimental results are discussed in this paper.</p>
<h3 align="JUSTIFY"><b>Experimental</h3>
</b><b>
<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><h4 align="JUSTIFY">Experimental setup</h4>
</b>
<p>A simple electrochemical cell (Figure 1) was employed in this work to study
crevice corrosion. A WBE was put on a ceramic semi-ball (with a diameter of 8.5
cm) under steady state conditions at room temperature to allow crevice corrosion
to occur. The electrochemical cell contained 350 mL of 3% NaCl brine.</p>
<p>The WBE used in this work was made from one hundred identical mild steel (UNS
No. G10350) wires. These wires were embedded in an epoxy resin, insulated from
each other with a very thin epoxy layer. Each wire had a diameter of 0.18 cm and
acted both as a minielectrode (sensor) and as a corrosion substrate. The working
area (the area occupied by the wire beam) was approximately 3.24 cm<font size="2">2</font>
(1.8 cm <font face="Symbol">ï¿½</font> 1.8 cm). The total metallic area was
approximately 2.55 cm<font size="2">2</font>. The distribution of these
minielectrodes in the working surface of the WBE is shown in Figure 1. The
working surface of the WBE was polished with 400, 800 and 1200 grit silicon
carbide paper and cleaned with ethanol and isopropanol.</p>
<b>
<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><h4 align="JUSTIFY">Data acquisition</h4>
</b>
<p>Corrosion potential distribution was obtained by measuring the open circuit
potential of each wire of a WBE (<i>E<font size="2">k</i></font> for the wire k)
against a 3M Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The terminals of wires in the
electrode were temporarily disconnected from the WBE system and connected in
sequence to an automatic zero resistance ammeter (autoZRA, ACM Instruments,
England) using a computer controlled automatic switch device (custom made). The
autoZRA, which is able to measure both current and voltage, was used to record
the corrosion potential. Its data logging software runs in the Microsoft Windows
environment complete with a real time Excel link. Thus the potential and current
data analysis and plotting can be performed with Microsoft Excel and Mathcad
software. Corrosion potentials from local areas of the electrode were measured
repeatedly during the experimental period, and were plotted to produce a
corrosion potential distribution map.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>The autoZRA was also connected in sequence between a chosen individual wire
terminal and all other terminals shorted together using the computer controlled
automatic switch to measure galvanic currents (I<font size="2">gk</font> for
wire k) flowing between each individual wire and the wire beam system. The
autoZRA enables current (325 mA to 10 pA) and voltage to be measured accurately
and to be recorded automatically. Galvanic corrosion currents from local areas
of the electrode are measured and plotted to produce a galvanic corrosion
current distribution map. The measurements were repeated during the experimental
period.</p>
<b>
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><h4 align="JUSTIFY">Data analysis for corrosion rate mapping</h4>
</b>
<p>Previously derived equations [6] can be used to calculate localised corrosion
rates at any selected location of the WBE surface. In this work, corrosion
reaction current of a selected wire k, <i>I<font size="2">ka</i></font>, was
calculated by,</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>I<font size="2">ka</font> = I<font size="2">gk</font>/<font size="5">{</font>1
    - exp[- (<img src="image168.gif" align="middle" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="42">)(E<font size="1">sys</font>
    - E<font size="1">k</font>)]<font size="5">} </i></font>(1)</p>
    <font size="1">
    </dir>
  </dir>
</font>
<p>Where <i>I<font size="2">gk</i></font> is galvanic current flowing between
wire k and the rest, <i>E<font size="2">sys</i></font> is the overall corrosion
potential of the whole WBE system, <i>E<font size="2">k</i> </font>is the
potential of wire <i>k</i>, <i>b<font size="2">ak</i></font> and <i>b<font size="2">ck</i></font>
are Tafel slopes (estimated).</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Applying equation 1 to each wire in a WBE (wires 1 to 100), corrosion
reaction current at all locations of the WBE can be calculated and be
transferred to corrosion rate distribution over the WBE surface. In this way the
corrosion rate and its distribution over the WBE can be mapped. A corrosion rate
distribution map gives information on the processes, rates and pattern of
localised or general corrosion.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><h3 align="JUSTIFY">Results and Discussion</h3>
<p>As shown in Figure 2, the electrode surface was electrochemically
heterogeneous during the 90 hours exposure. The potential maps show a nonuniform
potential distribution and there is a potential difference of over 200 mV
between anodic areas (inside region of the crevice zone) and cathodic areas
(outside region of the crevice zone). The most negative corrosion potential was
recorded around a ring-shaped area where the galvanic corrosion current was the
most positive (indicating electrons leaving the area).</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>The potential and galvanic current distribution data were used to calculate
corrosion rate distribution over the corroding electrode surface, using equation
1. It is clear that corrosion concentrated on the ring shaped area where
corrosion potential was the most negative. Corrosion rates are the highest on
this ring shapes area (Figure 2).</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>With the extension of the electrode exposure, as shown in Figure 2, the
anodic corrosion sites generally remained at similar locations on the electrode
surface although the specific corrosion rates did vary. As an accumulative
result, relatively heavy localised corrosion occurred around the ring shaped
area. This is shown in an accumulative corrosion depth map (Figure 3a) that was
obtained by summing the corrosion depths calculated over various periods of
exposure. For wire k, its total accumulative corrosion depth <i>TotalDepth<font size="2">k</i></font>
is,</p>
<i>
<p>TotalDepth<font size="2">k</i></font> = <i>CorrDepth(1)<font size="2">k</i></font>
+ <i>CorrDepth(2)<font size="2">k</i></font> + <i>CorrDepth(3)<font size="2">k</i></font>
+&#133;<i>CorrDepth(i)<font size="2">k</i></font> +&#133; (2)</p>
<p>Where <i>CorrDepth(i)<font size="2">k</i></font> is the incremental corrosion
depth calculated using corrosion rate data measured during a specific exposure
period <i>i</i>, which is normally 24 hours.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>The accumulative corrosion depth map (Figure 3a) correlates quite well with
real corrosion appearance (Figure 3b). It is interesting to note that heavy
localised corrosion did not occur at the center of the crevice area. This
phenomenon may be related to the dependence of crevice corrosion on solution
chemistry, geometries of the crevice and other factors. Details of crevice
corrosion is under further investigation.</p>

</b>
<p>A WBE has been employed in a simple experiment for studying the processes of
crevice corrosion and its kinetics. Corrosion potential and galvanic current
distribution maps were experimentally measured and were used to calculate and
plot corrosion rate distribution maps. Comparison between calculated corrosion
depth map and corrosion appearance shows a good correlation. This work shows
that the WBE is a practical tool for studying crevice corrosion.</p>
