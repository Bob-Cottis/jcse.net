Abstract
The effect of some organic compounds on the corrosion behaviour of copper - iron alloy (I) ( 95.53 % Cu, 4.47% Fe ) and copper aluminium - iron alloys ( II) ( 84.31 % Cu , 10.67% Al, 5.02 % Fe ) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was investigated . The techniques of measurements were : weight loss , linear polarization and impedance. These organic compounds were : glycine (I), alanine (II), valine (III), Histidine (IV), 2- aminothiazole (V) and 3- methyl -1- phenyl -2- pyrazolin -5- one (VI).These compounds have high inhibiting effect on the corrosion of alloys ( I,II) in H2SO4.Their inhibition efficiency increases according to the order : I < II < III < IV < VI < V . The inhibitory effect of these compounds is achieved by their adsorption on the metallic surface via adsorption centers ( N - atom and / or S- atom ) . Their adsorption the metallic surface follows Temkin's isotherm of adsorption The values of standard free energy of adsorption , Goads,were calculated from the adsorption isotherms. The negative values of Goads indicate the adsorption process occurs spontaneously. There is agreement between the results obtained from the different techniques of measurements. Keywords : corrosion, inhibitors, copper alloys .

Introduction
Copper and its alloys have a long history of use in marine applications and continue to be widely used for many purposes despite the emergence in recent years of other materials that have technical or economic attraction [1]. These related to their corrosion resistance, mechanical workability, excellent electrical and thermal conductivities and resistance to macrofouling [2]. The corrosion resistance of copper alloys has been attributed to the formation of a protective film of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and to the doping of Cu2O layer with ions such as iron [3, 4]. This doping reduces the ionic or electronic conductivity of the film, improving the corrosion resistance. In practice alloying additions of Al, Zn, Sn, Fe, Ni are used to dope the corrosion product films. Inhibition by benzotriazole (BTA) [5-17], throurea [18-20] and different organic compounds containing NH or NH2 has been extensively studied [21-27] because of their high efficiency as inhibitors for the corrosion of copper and copper alloys in various media .The inhibition of aluminium bronze by 4-phenyl semicarbazide hyderochloride (PSC), both in the absence and in presence of KI was studied in pure HC1 [28] and in acidified 4% NaCl solution [29]. In the present work the effect of some organic inhibitors on the corrosion behaviour of copper- iron and copper ­ aluminium iron alloys in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution was studied.

Experimental
Two types of copper alloys were used in this study. The first alloy (I) contains ( 95.53 % Cu, 4.47% Fe ) ,while the second alloy (II) contains (84.31 % Cu , 10.67% Al, 5.02 % Fe ) .

(1,2) and tables (1,2) indicated that the investigated organic compounds have high inhibiting effect on the corrosion of alloy (I, II) in H2SO4 solution. The inhibition efficiency, I%, of the investigated organic compounds increases according to the order : I<II<III<IV<VI<V 2. Linear polarization measurements : Figs.(3,4)represent the plots of potential, E, versus the current density, i, for the alloys (I,II), respectively, in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution in absence and in presence of different concentrations of compound (I). Similar plots are obtained for the alloys (I,II) in presence of different concentrations of the other organic compounds (II, III, IV, V, VI) but not shown. The values of linear polarization resistance, Rp, are deduced from the slopes (E/i) of straight lines of the plots of Figs.

presence of inhibitors (I ­ VI) in 0.5M H2SO4 solution. The results of these tables indicate that the inhibition efficiency of the investigated organic compounds is high and increases according the order : I<II<III<IV<VI<V. This order is the same as that obtained from the weight-loss measurements. 3. Impedance measurements : Figs. (5,6) represent the impedance diagrams (Nyquist plots) for the alloy (I, II), respectively, in 0.5M H2SO4 in presence of different concentrations of compound (I). Similar plots are obtained for the other organic compounds (II, III, IV, V, VI) but not shown. These impedance diagrams are not perfect semicircles and has been attributed to frequencies dispersion [30,31]. The charge transfer resistance (Rt) values are calculated from the difference in impedance at lower and higher frequency, as suggested previously [32-34]. The double layer capacitance, Cdl, was determined from the frequency, f, at which Zi, was maximum, using the following relationship. f(-Zi,max) = (2Cdl Rt) ...............

alloy (I), and in table (6) for alloy (II). The results of these tables indicate that as the inhibitor concentration increases the values of Rt and I% increase, but the values of Cdl decrease. This indicates the occurrence of adsorption of the organic compounds on the alloys surface. Also , the inhibition efficiency, I%, of the investigated organic compounds increases according to the order : I<II< III< IV< VI< V. This order is the same as those obtained by weight-loss and linear polarization measurements. Fig.(7) represents the plots of variation of the values of Rt with the concentration of compound (I) for the alloys (I, II). Similar plots are obtained in presence of different concentrations of the other compounds (II, III, IV, V, VI), but not shown. The plots of Fig.(7) and similar ones indicate that the values of Rt increase with the increase of inhibitors concentration.

Similar plots are obtained in presence of different concentrations of the other compounds (II, III, IV,V, VI) but not shown. The plots of Fig. (8) and similar ones indicate that the values of Cdl decrease with increasing inhibitors concentration. This indicates, as above mentioned, the occurrence of adsorption of inhibitors molecules, on the surface of the investigated alloys. As suggested by Hoar and Holliday [35], there may be on the metal surface cathodic and anodic sites providing centers for cathodic and anodic reactions. The adsorption of an inhibitor takes place through physical and chemisorption [36]. At the cathodic site on the metal

The adsorption of an organic adsorbate on the surface of a metal can be regarded as a substitutional adsorption process between the organic compound in aqueous phase org(aq) adsorbed on the electrode surface H2O(s) [37]. Org (aq) + xH2O(s) Org (s) + xH2O(aq) and water molecules

Where (x) is the size ratio, which is the number of water molecules replaced by one molecule of organic adsorbate. The above process attains equilibrium when : µorg(aq) + µxH2O(S) = µorg(s) + µxH2O(aq) where (µ) is the chemical potential. Experimental relationships for the adsorption of organic inhibitors from the aqueous solution on the metallic surface versus concentration follow either the adsorption isotherms of Langmiur, Temkin, Frumkin, Hill de Boer and Parsons [38-41] in which the molecular interaction parameter (a) is included or the adsorption isotherms of Flory-Huggins, Dhar- Flory ­ Huggins and Bockris ­ Swinkels.

In the later isotherms the number of water molecules replaced by one molecule of organic adsorbate (x) is included . All the above isotherms are essentially of the form [42, 43]. f(, x) exp (-a) = KC (7)

Where  is a surface coverage, it can be calculated by applying the above ­mentioned equations (1,3), C is the inhibitor concentration in the bulk of solution and f (, x) is the configurational factor that depends essentially on the physical model and assumptions underlying derivation of the isotherm [43]. Moreover, all the above expressions include the equilibrium constant of the adsorption process (K) which is related to the standard free energy of adsorption G°ads by:
K= - G ° ads 1 exp 55.5 RT (8)

Equations (7, 8) have been used in this study to evaluate the most suitable isotherm describing the adsorption of the investigated organic compounds (I-VI) onto the alloys (I, II) surface. Upon rearrangement of equation (7), the following equation is obtained ;

The straight lines of Figs.(9-10) have slopes of (1/-2a ) and an intercept of (1/-2a lnK). The values of (K) can be determined and from them the standard free energy (G°ads) can be calculated using equation (8). Also, the values of (a) can be calculated from the slopes of obtained straight lines of Figs.(9-10). The values of (G°ads) and (a) are listed in table (7). The negative values of (G°ads) indicate that the adsorption of the investigated organic compounds on the surface of the alloys (I, II) is a spontaneous process [44]. The inhibition efficiency of the additive compounds depends on many factors including : the number of adsorption sites and their charge density, molecular size, heat of hydrogenation, mode of interaction with the metal and formation of metallic complex [45]. The possibility correlating structural characteristics with the inhibitor properties of organic substances is justified by the fact that the metal- inhibitor interactions are based on chemisorption. The electron density of the organic function can be defined as the reaction center for the establishment of the adsorption bond is then obviously important, since it is possible to assume a bond of the Lewis acid-base type [46], generally with the inhibitor as the electron donor and metal as the electron acceptor. The strength of this bond depends on the characteristics of both the adsorbent and adsorbate.

Organic compounds containing lone pairs and/or multiple bonds are usually effective inhibitors. Thus organic inhibitors are compounds with at least one polar function, having atoms of nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen and in some cases selenium and phosphorus. In such a case the adsorption bond strength is determined by the electron density of the atom acting as the reaction center and the polarizability of the function atoms.The effectivness of the function atoms with respect to the adsorption process, when the stabilities of the compounds are equal can be taken as being in the following sequence : Se>S>N>O [47-50]. The obtained results in the present studies indicate that the inhibition efficiency, I%, of the investigated organic compounds increases according to the order : I<II<II<IV<VI<V. This may be attributed to that compound (V) (2-aminiothiazole) contains more than one adsorption center including nitrogen and sulphur atoms, state of which gives more strong adsorption bond between the organic compound and the metallic surface. The compound (VI) (3-methyl- 1-phenyl-2pyrazolin-5-one) contains more than one adsorption centers including nitrogen and oxygen atoms and also benzene ring state of which gives strong adsorption bond between the compound and the metallic surface. For this reason the inhibition efficiency of compound VI is less than that of compound (V) and higher than that of other compounds (I, II, III, IV). The inhibition efficiency, I%, of compounds (I, II, III, IV) are less than that of compounds (VI) and (V). Also, the inhibition efficiency of this series of compounds, (I - IV) increases according to the order : I<II< III< IV. The structural formulae of these compounds can be written as :

For the compounds I, II, III, VI, respectively. The increase of the length of R in the investigated compounds increases their molecular size which in turn increases their inhibition efficiency. In compound IV there is more than one adsorption center, in addition to its increased molecular size, the resulted inhibition efficiency is higher than that of compound : I, II, III, for this reason the above mentioned order (I<II<III< IV) is obtained. Conclusion: 1- The investigated organic compounds have high inhibiting effect on the corrosion of copper alloys ( I, II ) in H2SO4 solution . The inhibition efficiency, I %, of these compounds increases according the order: I < II < III < IV < VI < V . 2-The inhibitory effect of these compounds is achieved by their adsorption on the metallic surface via the adsorption centers ( N atom and / or S- atom ) . Their adsorption on the metallic surface follows Temkin's isotherm of adsorption .
