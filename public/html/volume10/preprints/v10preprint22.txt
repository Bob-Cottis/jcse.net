Introduction
The corrosion process of carbon steel pipelines in gas and oilfield mining induced by the presence of carbon dioxide and water has been a serious problem in the oil and gas industry for decades [1]. One of parts of carbon steel pipelines, caused by carbon dioxide and other acidic media is the use of organic corrosion inhibitors [1][2][3][4]. The common organic corrosion inhibitors that widely and commercially used to minimize the corrosion induced by carbon dioxide and acidic media in the gas and oilfield industries are imidazoline derivative compounds. Recently, the studies concerning the correlation between the structure of organic corrosion inhibitors and their corrosion inhibition ability have been quite numerous. There are several studies involving the effect of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur containing compounds, acyclic and heterocyclic, towards the corrosion inhibition ability [5][6][7][8]. In Indonesia, the gas and oilfield mining is still one of important industries that would give valuable commodity and income to the nation. Therefore, the quest of better performance of organic corrosion inhibitor would be quite crucial considering the effectiveness of production cost. This work was contributed to this sort of quest as well as to the most essential purpose in practicing science methodology. The purpose of this work mainly is to synthesize some imidazole derivative compounds utilizing the novel method in organic synthesis, microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS). Many scientists have been engaged in a vast of disciplines that have applied the rapid heating associated with microwave technology to a number of useful processes [9][10][11][12]. This technology opens up new opportunities to the synthetic chemist, in the form of new reactions that are not possible using conventional heating, improved reaction 2 the most effective ways to protect the corrosion, especially the internal

yields, decreased reaction times and even solvent free reaction conditions [10].

The other aim of this work is to analyze the correlation between the

synthesized products structure and their corrosion inhibition activities towards carbon steel in 1% NaCl solution utilizing Tafel plot method. Therefore, in this paper we report some results of the microwaveassisted organic synthesis of some imidazole derivative compounds carbon steel in 1% NaCl solution.

and the analysis of their corrosion inhibitor corrosion activities toward

Experimental
A. General Procedure All of reagents used in this research are GR grade. All of solvents were distilled before used. The microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) method was utilizing a GE domestic microwave oven type JEI642WC. The characterization of synthesized products was analyzed using BUCK-IR® at Department of Chemistry ITB for the determination of infrared spectrums, and the determination of the melting point of structure elucidation was determined utilizing JEOL DELTA NMR 400 MHz (1H-NMR) and 100 MHz (13C-NMR), using CDCl3 and acetone-d6 as solvents, at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. The determination of inhibition activity of synthesized products employing VoltaLab® apparatus at Department of Chemistry ITB, with carbon steel electrode as working electrode, SCE (Saturated Calomel Electrode) as reference electrode, and platinum electrode as auxiliary electrode. B. The Synthesis of Imidazole Derivative Compounds All of the synthesis procedures of imidazole derivative compounds were summarized as follows (also presented in Scheme 1). This method was the modification of the method used previously by Wolkenberg, et.al. [11] and Usyatinsky, et.al. [12]: 2 mmols of diketones (glyoxal for the synthesis of unsubstituted imidazole; benzil for the synthesis of compound 1, compound 2 and compound 3), 2 mmols of aldehydes, 20 mmols of ammonium acetate and 10 mL acetic acid glacial were placed in 100 mL PYREX® Erlenmeyer flask. The 3 products utilizing the Fisher-Johns® Melt-Temp Apparatus. The

reaction mixtures were stirred well, and then the flask was placed in

the GE domestic microwave oven type JEI642WC. The reaction mixtures were irradiated at 700 W of power for several times until the reaction temperature was no longer raised or achieving the stable temperature. The flask was taken out from the oven and was cooled to 40oC. Then the flask was placed in the ice bath. Into the reaction mixtures were cloudiness appeared. The crude products were filtered out and the residue was washed with aquadest. The crude products were purified utilizing preparative TLC with n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 7:3 (V/V) as eluents. The product were recrystallized in n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 1:1 (V/V).

From Table 2 it was observed that the corrosion inhibition activities of imidazole derivative compounds depend on the structure and substituents attached to the imidazole ring framework. Compound 1 (2,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazole) gave the highest corrosion inhibition corrosion inhibition activity should be related to the presence of three aromatic benzene rings attached to imidazole ring framework, which have the potent to interact with iron of carbon steel through their phi's () electrons as Lewis base. The planarity of compound 1's structure should be an additional account to the readily close packed in the activities than unsubstituted imidazole, compound 2 and 3. This

interaction process with carbon steel surface. The additional phi's () electron at the N(1) position and the ethyl substituent at C(2) position of imidazole ring of compound 3 ((E)-2-ethyl-4,5-diphenyl-1-(prop1-enyl)-1H-imidazole) contributed to the better corrosion inhibition activity of compound 3 compare to unsubstituted imidazole. The electron-donating group of ethyl substituent on compound 3 increased the basicity of imidazole ring framework; therefore it would be a better Lewis base to interact with the acid Lewis carbon steel. On the other hand, the similar electron donating property of hexyl substituent on compound 2 (2-hexyl-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole) did 7

not increase its corrosion inhibition activity compare to unsubstituted imidazole. The basicity of compound 2 should be higher than unsubstituted imidazole; however the steric and bulky structure caused by the presence of long alkyl group (hexyl group) would prevent the close packed interaction between compound 2 and carbon not achieve the better protection on carbon steel surface. steel surface. Therefore the preventive layer made by compound 2 did

are at lone pair electrons of imidazole ring and phi's () electrons of three aromatic benzene rings and imidazole ring itself. The adsorption sites of compound 1 are more various in amount and

quality than imidazole, compound 2 and 3 resulting the highest in its corrosion inhibition activity and the more negative of its free Gibbs adsorption energy. Thus compound 1 has the most spontaneous

adsorption process on metal surface than others. On the other hand, unsubstituted imidazole has the least interaction than the others that caused the smallest efficiency inhibition and the least adsorption spontaneity on metal surface. The steric hindrance of hexyl group of compound 2 has made the interaction between its Lewis bases sites and the Lewis acid metal surface became weaker than compound 1 and 3 that caused the low efficiency corrosion inhibition.

Conclusions
The synthesis of imidazole derivative compounds utilizing the MAOS method produced four types of compounds: imidazole, compound 1(2,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazole), 2 (2-hexyl-4,5-diphenyl-1Himidazole) and 3 ((E)-2-ethyl-4,5-diphenyl-1-(prop-1-enyl)-1Himidazole). Compound 1 has the highest corrosion inhibition activity towards carbon steel (52.12%) at 8 ppm concentrations in 1% NaCl solution. Based on the analysis of Tafel plot data, the most suitable relationship between concentration of corrosion inhibitor compounds,

Cinh, and the degree of surface coverage, , is the Langmuir isotherm
