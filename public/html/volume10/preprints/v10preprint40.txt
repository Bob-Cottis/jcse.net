Abstract : The corrosion behavior of Tin coated steel in monochloroacetic acid
and its inhibition by chromates and dichromates were studied by using weight loss technique at 35 to 55 ± 0.1 ºC. All the data reveal that chromates and dichromates acts as an inhibitor in the acid environment. The % inhibition efficiency of chromates and dichromates decrease with increase in inhibitor concentration, period of immersion and temperature. The experimental data fits into the Temkin, Fruendlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. Thermodynamic parameters for adsorption of chromates and dichromates were calculated from the experimental data.

Introduction :
Corrosion is inevitable [1] and is a serious problem because it contribute to depletion of our natural resources, pollution of environment, loss in term of cost and human life in term of accident. Severity of corrosion problem varies from place to place because the process of corrosion depends on a number of factors. Ignorance sometimes is the cause of many premature unexpected and expensive failures due to corrosion problems [2]. Electrolytic Tinplate undoubtedly enjoys the pride of place as a packaging medium especially for food. It owes its unique position to its " nine layers sandwich structure", each of which contributes to its eminence as a packing material.

etc. Today TCIL, India is also capable of supplying excellent quality of thin strip DR for Instant Coffee packaging and other OTS products in the range of 0.17mm, 0.19mm and 0.21mm respectively. Detailed review of literature has revealed that bulk of work is carried out on mild steel and a little work is available on coated steel. Only a few references are available on Tin Coated Steel.

Experimental :
Tin coated steel used in present work has procured by Tata Tin Plate, Jamshedpur, India. Each sheet was 0.21mm in thickness, Type is Double reduced, Grade Coating is Equally Coated, Temper Designation is DR 550 (DR 08), Hardness 30RT is 73 +3/-3 and Classification is Bright finish. The chemicals used were of A.R. grade. All the solutions were prepared in conductivity water and standardized by different method [3] and their purities were checked by noting their melting points, solubility and crystallization method [4]. For weight loss studies, rectangular specimens of area 6 cm × 3 cm (thickness 0.21mm) with a small hole of about 2 mm diameters just near the one end (3 cm side end) of the specimen for suspension has been used. Each specimen was first washed with distilled water and dried. The specimen was finally degreased by A.R. carbon tetrachloride. The test specimens were exposed to 0.5M solution of monochloroacetic acid containing controlled additions of various chromates and dichromates viz., Potassium chromate, Sodium chromate, Potassium dichromate, Sodium dichromate and Ammonium dichromate. The specimen was weighted in single pan balance (Matelar Tolado AB 204 electronic balance) to an accuracy of ±0.0001gm. Then one specimen at a time was suspended by a glass-hook in each beaker (Borosil) which contained 230 ml of the test solution, the solution being open to air at 35 ± 0.1°C and left exposed to the air for various immersion periods (1 to 4 hours). Similar experiments were also carried out at other temperatures, viz., 40°, 45°, 50° and 55°C. For maintaining temperature the specimen were placed in a corrosive medium in " High Precision Water Bath" Cat. No. MSW ­ 274 with readability ± 0.1°C.

Results and discussion :
The weight loss of the Tin coated steel coupons in 0.5M monochloroacetic acid in the absence and presence of different concentrations of chromates and dichromates at 35 ± 0.1 ºC were determined. From the weight loss values determined, the % inhibition efficiencies (% I ) were calculated using the following equation [7-8].

Effect of immersion period :
To determine the effect of immersion period on inhibitive efficiency, weight losses were determined in 0.5M monochloroacetic acid containing 1% inhibitor for immersion periods of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours (fig. 2). From the inhibitive efficiencies given in table - 2 it may be generalized that the efficiency of Sodium chromate and Ammonium dichromate decrease with time up to an immersion period of 4 hours.

Out of Potassium chromate, Potassium dichromate and Sodium dichromate is almost similar to that of Sodium chromate. It is observed that the inhibitor efficiency decreases in most of cases with increase in period of immersion. This may be due to the desorption of the adsorbed inhibitor molecules at more duration of time and thus exposing the metal surface to further attack [9]. For immersion periods ranging from 2 to 4 hour, the general order of inhibitor efficiency is as under : Sodium dichromate < Potassium dichromate < Potassium chromate < Sodium chromate < Ammonium dichromate. However, for 1 hour immersion period, the efficiency increases in the same order as 2 to 4 hours.

submitted 16 July 2007

To determine the effect of temperature on inhibitive efficiency, weight losses were determined in 0.5M monochloroacetic acid containing 1% inhibitor at solution temperatures of 35°, 40°, 45°, 50° and 55°C in table ­ 3 and fig. 3. It is seen that the extent of corrosion in inhibited as well as uninhibited acid increases with a rise in temperature, the loss in weight being much higher in plain acid. The result also show that all the five compounds studied decrease the corrosion rate to an appreciable extent, the extent of inhibition ranging from 34 % to 94 %. From the weight losses it may be generalized that here also Sodium chromate and Ammonium dichromate appears to be the best inhibitors.

and also from the plot of log  Vs 1/T where  is the corrosion rate at temperature T (K) and R is the gas constant. From the Ea value (table ­ 4), it is apparent that for the corrosion of Tin coated steel in uninhibited acid the Ea value is 8.66kcal/mol where as inhibited acid the values are higher and range from 14.12kcal/mol (Potassium chromate) to 32.35kcal/mol (Sodium

chromate). In inhibited acid, the Ea values, thus vary and depend on the inhibitive power of the inhibitor. It appears that the exponential term in the Arrhenius equation appreciably changes the Ea value with a slight change in the corrosion rate. The higher value of activation energy in inhibited acid suggest that the adsorption of the inhibitor on the metal surface may be physical or weak in nature [10]. According to Putilova [11] et. al. the behavior of those inhibitors whose activity decreases with a rise in temperature and in whose presence the activation energies are higher in inhibited than in uninhibited acid may be compared with that of unstable catalyst poisons whose adsorption decreases with increasing temperature.

linear showing an adsorption on the metal and alloy surface electrode according to the Langmuir isotherm [19]. Negative values [22] of G indicates strong interaction of inhibitor molecule and spontaneous adsorption of inhibitor on the Tin Coated Steel surface. The standard free energy of adsorption values in 0.5M

monochloroacetic acid for inhibitors under investigation are within limit of -7.80 to -3.84 kcal/mol. Such results have been observed in majority of inhibitors of various types in acid aqueous media [23-26]. However in 0.5M acid, where in inhibitor efficiency are more differentiated because G values are more negative for good inhibitor like for Sodium dichromate and Ammonium dichromate than those of less efficient inhibitors like Potassium dichromate.

[II] Enthalpy and Entropy of adsorption Enthalpy of adsorption and Entropy of adsorption were calculated this equation as under

Where R is gas constant.

This agrees with general suggestion that more negative values of G and positive value of S leads to increase in inhibitor efficiency [27]. The positive values of entropy of adsorption S suggest the adsorption to be a spontaneous process. But order of efficiency of different inhibitors and the order of decrease or increase w.r.t. S do not agree and these suggest decrease in free energy is the controlling factor in adsorption process.

Conclusion.
In general for all selected inhibitors, rate of corrosion increases with rise of temperature and increase in immersion period; and efficiency of inhibitors decreases with rise of temperature. From weight loss data it may be generalized that corrosion protection is high for short period of time for all the
