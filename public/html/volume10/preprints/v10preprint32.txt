ABSTRACT A novel series of self-assembled nonionic Schiff base amphiphiles were synthesized and their chemical structures were confirmed using elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and 1HNMR spectra. The surface activities of these amphiphiles were determined based on the data of surface and interfacial tension, critical micelle concentration, effectiveness, efficiency, maximum surface excess and minimum surface area. Thermodynamics of adsorption and micellization processes of these amphiphiles in their solutions were also calculated. The surface and thermodynamic data showed their higher tendency towards adsorption at the interfaces. The synthesized amphiphiles were evaluated as corrosion inhibitors for aluminum (3SR) at different doses (400-10 ppm) in acidic medium (4N HCl) using weight loss and hydrogen evolution techniques. The corrosion measurements showed that the synthesized nonionic schiff bases could serve as effective corrosion inhibitors. The surface and corrosion inhibition activities were correlated to the chemical structures of the inhibitors KEYWORDS Nonionic surfactant, Schiff base, adsorption, surface tension, corrosion inhibition, corrosion rate, inhibition efficiency. INTRODUCTION Ferrous, nonferrous metals and their alloys are extensively used in industry. To remove unwanted scale and salt deposits or mill scales formed during manufacture, metals are immersed in acid solutions, which are known as an acid pickling bath. After the scale is removed, the metal may be subjected to attack by the acids. In order to reduce the degree of metal attack and rate of consumption of the acid, corrosion inhibitors are added to the pickling solutions. Hydrochloric and sulphuric acids are the most commonly used acids in the pickling bath

provide a convenient method for corrosion inhibition, since the process of self-assembling is simple, and the chemical composition and thickness of self-assembled monolayers can be tailored by design and synthesis of the adsorption agent. The practical applications of selfassembled monolayers as corrosion inhibitors were explored by several investigators (11-14). It was found that densely packed self-assembled monolayers heteroatom containing compounds were effective for blocking certain electrochemical processes, thus effectively act as corrosion inhibitors. In this study, different self-assembled inhibitors containing polyethylene glycol chains with different molecular weights and schiff base terminal group were synthesized. The corrosion inhibition efficiencies of these compounds towards aluminum alloy were examined using weight loss and hydrogen evolution techniques. The surface activities of these schiff base amphiphiles and the surface activity-corrosion inhibition-chemical structure relationships were also discussed. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Synthesis of Schiff bases 0.5 mole of aldehydes (anisaldehyde and/or furfuraldehyde, respectively) was condensed with 0.5 mole of p-aminobenzoic acid in presence of 250 mL of ethyl alcohol as a solvent. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 hours and then left overnight until the product was precipitated. The product was washed by petroleum ether and recrystallized from ethanol. The final product was dried under vacuum at 40oC (15). The produced Schiff bases were denoted as ASB-p-ABA and FSB-p-ABA and their chemical structures were represented in Scheme 1.

Surface and interfacial tension measurements Surface tension measurements were made for freshly prepared inhibitors solutions in a concentration range of 0.1 to 0.0001 M/L at 25oC using a Du-Nuoy Tensiometer-Kruss-K100. Also, interfacial tension measurements were made for inhibitors-oil systems (17). Weight loss determination Aluminum coupons of 10cm2 were used for weight loss measurement. Different concentrations of the inhibitors (400-10 ppm) in 4N HCl solution were used at 25oC. Coupons were placed in the corrodent-inhibitor systems and removed at 1 hour interval for 4 hours. The tested specimens were washed with distilled water and ethanol then dried and weighted. The difference in the weight was taken as the weight loss in mg. The percentage inhibitor efficiency was calculated as (18): % Efficiency
= Wb - W X 100 Wb

where Wb and W are the weight loss of aluminum specimens without and with inhibitors, respectively. The corrosion rates were calculated according to the following formula: Cr (mpy) = (KW)/(ATD) where; K = constant, A = area, T = time, W = weight loss in mg and D = density.

21 April 2007

In the gas evolution measurement, the corrosion rates of aluminum were investigated by the hydrogen evolution rate with the inhibitors concentrations of 400, 200, 100, 50, 25 and 10 ppm and 4N HCl solution without inhibitors. The hydrogen evolved is a function of the corrosion reaction and it displaced the fluid in the gasometeric setup, which is read directly. Experiments performed without inhibitors recorded the highest volume of hydrogen gas evolved (19). The percentage efficiency was calculated as: % Efficiency =
Vb - V X 100 Vb

where Vb and V are the volumes of hydrogen evolved without and with inhibitors respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Surface Activity Effect of hydrophobic chain length Figure 1 represents the relation between the surface tension and ­log concentration of the synthesized nonionic Schiff base amphiphiles containing similar polyethylene glycol content (n = 46 EO units) at 25oC. It is clear that the surface tension profile has the characteristics of the nonionic surfactants. That appeared in the relatively higher surface tension values. Also, it could be observed that increasing the number of methylene groups along the hydrophobic chains from 10 to 18 units decreases the critical micelle concentrations gradually effect was explained in a previous work
(20-21) (17)

. That

due to the repulsion occurred between the

hydrophobic chains (nonpolar phase) and the water phase (polar phase), which forced the molecules to adsorb at the air-water interface and to micellize in the bulk of their solutions in order to decrease that repulsion. While, the lowest CMC values was observed for SBG-2000oleate at 0.0009 M/L at 25oC, which referred to the above reasons and also to the unsaturation in oleate chain which increase the repulsion extent. The effectiveness (cmc) values showed gradual decrease by increasing the hydrophobic chain length indicating the increasing of accumulated surfactant molecules at the interface. The maximum accumulation was indicated by the lowest surface tension depression at the critical micelle concentration and was recorded for SBG-2000-oleate molecules at 44 mN/m. The effectiveness values as well as the maximum surface excess considered as a clear description for the accumulation extent of amphiphiles molecules at the air-water interface. The calculated values of the maximum surface excess showed increasing trend from SBG2000-decanoate to SBG-2000-oleate as represented from the slope of pre-CMC region of surface tension profile (Figure 1). The maximum surface excess values were increased from 4

of surfactant molecules at the interface. Values of the minimum surface area occupied by the nonionic Schiff base amphiphiles at the interface (Amin) were calculated according to the equation: Amin = 1016 / (NAV . max) where, max and NAV are the maximum surface excess and Avogadro's number, respectively. Increasing the maximum surface excess values indicates the increasing of adsorbed molecules at the interface, hence the area available for each molecule will decrease. That causes the compacting of surfactant molecules at the interface to form denser layer. The values of critical micelle concentration, effectiveness, maximum surface excess and minimum surface area of the Schiff base nonionic amphiphiles were listed in Table (2). Effect of polyethylene oxide content Figure 2 represents the effect of ethylene oxide content on the surface activity of the synthesized nonionic schiff base amphiphiles. It is clear that increasing the number of ethylene oxide units within the nonionic moiety increases the hydrophilic characters of these molecules, which increases their critical micelle concentrations and also their surface tension values. The increasing of CMC values can be referred to the formation of hydrogen bonds (HBs) between amphiphiles-water molecules. HBs increase the adsorption of these amphiphiles at the air-water interface, which increases the CMC values gradually. On the other hand, the effectiveness (CMC) values of the synthesized Schiff base nonionic amphiphiles. SBG-n-16 were increased gradually by increasing the length (n) of the nonionic moiety (where n = 9, 14, 23 and 68) (22-23). The effectiveness (CMC) and the efficiency (pC20) values were showed an increasing trend by increasing the hydrophobic chain length. The maximum lowering in the surface tension values was corresponded to the SBG-2000-oleate. The maximum surface excess (max) values indicate lower surface concentration for lower ethylene oxide containing amphiphiles. On contrarily, the minimum surface area (Amin) values increased by increasing the nonionic chain lengths, (Table 2). Thermodynamics of Adsorption and Micellization The micellization and adsorption processes of the amphiphile molecules are occurred instantly. But, in common, one process may be predominating than the other one. The predominance of any of the two processes is governed by the thermodynamic variables of this process. In the investigated amphiphiles, both adsorption and micellization thermodynamic functions were calculated based on the methodology of Rosen, et al (24) and using the surface activity data in Table (2). The free energy changes of micellization and adsorption showed

decreased gradually by increasing the hydrophobic chain lengths. But, Gads has slight increase in negativity than Gmic. The maximum depression in Gmic and Gads was observed at -12.04 and 12.11 Kj/Mole for SBG-2000-oleate, respectively. That showed the higher tendency of these amphiphiles towards adsorption rather than micellization. The tendency towards adsorption is refereed to the interaction between the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic chains which pumps the amphiphile molecules to the interface. The presence of these amphiphiles at the interface decreases the different in phases interactions. Corrosion Inhibition Efficiency Effect of alkyl chain length Figure 3 represents the variation of corrosion inhibition efficiency of the synthesized nonionic schiff bases amphiphiles containing constant ethylene oxide content (n = 45 EO units). It is clear that the inhibition efficiency increased by increasing the number of repeated methylene groups in the hydrophobic chains. Schiff base polyethylene glycol ABA-2000 showed the maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency at 55.28%. Comparison between the corrosion rate of the different hydrophobic chains (Figure 3) showed the following trend: oleate > stearate > palmitate > decanoate. That behavior could be referred for two factors. First, the surface activity of these inhibitors at the interfaces. Second, the longer hydrophobic chains neighbored to each other can easily overlapped. That forms a condensed nonpolar layer faced the polar aggressive medium. Hence, good isolation occurred and the corrosion process stopped. The presence of coiling in these chains or unsaturation sites enhances their overlapping. That effect appears obviously in case of stearate and oleate derivatives. Increasing the adsorption tendency is directing them towards the metal/corrosive medium interface where the inhibitor molecules act as a barrier; hence corrosion process steadily decreased
(25)

. Table (2) also showed that Amin values of the inhibitor molecules at the

interface increased by increasing the number of methylene groups in their chains. That enforcing the molecular visualize to act as a blanket aligned with the aggressive medium and fade away its destructive action as shown in case of SBG-2000-oleate, (Amin = 110.01 A2). Since, the hydrogen evolution and weight loss techniques were used to assure the accuracy and the reproducibility of the results. Hence, Figures (3, 4) showed that the inhibition efficiency of the two techniques are highly comparable having very close values. The invariability confirms the accuracy of the inhibitors efficiency values.

Figure (5) represents the variation of corrosion inhibition efficiencies of nonionic schiff base derivatives bearing different ethylene oxide contents (400, 1000, 2000 and 3000) at constant hydrophobic chain (palmitate). The corrosion inhibition efficiency was increasingly varied by decreasing the PEO content. Higher PEO content increases the hydrophilicity of these compounds. Hence, molecules tend to locate in the aqueous medium, which decreases their adsorption tendency at the interfaces. Consequently, their accumulation at the metal surface decreased. That explains their low efficiency as corrosion inhibitors. On contrarily, lower PEO containing derivatives had higher surface activity due to their high hydrophobicity. That directs these molecules towards accumulation at the interfaces. Hence, their corrosion inhibition efficiencies increased (18). Effect of inhibitor doses Figure (6) represents the effect of the synthesized corrosion inhibitor doses on their corrosion inhibition efficiency for aluminum alloy in acidic medium at 25oC. It is clear that, at higher doses (400 ppm),  appears in the lowest values. Decreasing the doses to 200 ppm and 100 ppm increases the inhibition efficiencies to higher extent, till reaches the maximum around 100 ppm. Meanwhile, further decrease in the inhibitor concentrations (50, 25 and 10 ppm) turns the efficiencies to lower values, but remains higher than those belonged to 400 ppm. That behavior could be rationalized to the micellization and micelle formation of these inhibitors (amphiphiles). At lower inhibitor doses (10, 25 and 50 ppm), the molecules are pumped to the interfaces and participated in the formation of isolating layer at the metal surface, hence the corrosion efficiency increased. The 150 ppm dose is considered a critical dose, that is due to the metal surface is completely covered by inhibitor molecules, which appears the highest corrosion inhibition efficiency. That is due to micelle formation neat that concentration. The lowering in corrosion inhibition efficiencies upon increasing the inhibitor concentrations implements the idea that the inhibition occurred through a molecular mechanism and not the micellar one. Corrosion inhibition mechanism The mechanism of inhibition processes of the corrosion inhibitors is mainly the adsorption one. The process of adsorption is governed by different parameters depend almost on the chemical structure of the inhibitors. The adsorption process is occurred either physically or chemically. Figure (6) indicates that the inhibition efficiency increased by increasing the doses of the used inhibitors until the maximum  values at 100 ppm. Then, the efficiency decreased gradually by increasing the inhibitor concentration. That indicates the formation of

. That conclusion can

be interpreted from Figure (7), which indicates the formation of only one S-shape proves the formation of one layer of the inhibitor molecules at the metal surface. REFERENCES 1.
