Abstract: The influence of concentration of corrosion inhibitor was studied under static and dynamic conditions on the heat exchanger copper alloy tubes metal corrosion rate, as this influence is important factor to choose the way to protect tubes metal during the acid cleaning to remove deposited scale inside them. It was found that increasing temperature decreases inhibitor efficiency, while increasing acid concentration needs higher inhibitor concentration but not higher than specific concentration where that will not decrease corrosion rate of copper alloy metal. Keywords: Corrosion; Corrosion Inhibitor

Introduction: Corrosion may occurred during the acid cleaning of the heat exchanger tubes , the good cleaning agent must be inhibited to protect the tubes metal , but at the same time the inhibitor must not prevent dissolution of the scale(1) . The corrosion increases with increasing the concentration or temperature , but could decreased by using inhibitors , longer contact time may be required for some deposits if better inhibited acid used(2) . The purpose of this work is to study the influence of inhibitor (Hexamine) (Hexa methyl tetra amine) concentration used in acid cleaning process(3). Various conditions tested of acid concentration, temperature and time on the copper alloy cooling system heat exchanger tubes in Daura refinery. All the bench- scale tests were carried out using field cleaned from deposited scale admiralty metal B (copper alloy C 44300) cooling tower heat exchanger(4). The tubing was of (19mm) outside diameter and (2mm) in thickness having the following chemical composition (table 1). Metal.

between acid solution and tubes metal with constant temperature of 70 and 6wt.% citric acid concentration vs. different concentrations of (Hexamine ) inhibitor were used ( 0.0 ,0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 ) wt.% at static condition .Where pieces of tubes 10 cm long were cut, inserted 2

between two pieces of teflon parts ,tied to insure isolating the external walls from acid solution and corrosion takes place only at inside and placed in 500 ml beakers containing 6 wt.% citric acid solution the results were as shown in table (2) . The results showed that at zero concentration of (Hexamine) inhibitor the weight loss ( i.e. corrosion rate ) was quite high while it was low and almost constant when inhibitor used at higher concentrations especially above 0.15 wt.% as shown in figure (1).

Influence of Inhibitor Concentration on Tubes Metal Corrosion Rate under Dynamic Conditions: A dynamic system was assembled for corrosion rate investigation ,all made of Q.V.F. glass parts ,it consist of round bottom container with four necks, connected with glass coil heat exchanger .The circulation of acid solution was effected using Q.V.F. pump (0.25Kwatt) fig.(2).

The tested also was inserted between two teflon pieces ,the flow system contained 15 liter of circulating acid solution , all tests carried out to determine the corrosion rate by measuring the weight difference of specimen at the start and end of each test. So for every sample after each test the tube was washed with distilled water ,oven dried at 60 oC for 24 hr and weighed .

The effect of the concentration of inhibitor was studied under dynamic condition for different concentrations of (Hexamine) inhibitor (0.0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.35 , 0.75), with two level of acid concentration ( 2 , 5) wt.% and temperature ( 40 , 72 ) oC at constant time of 2 hr. Four sets of experiments were chosen with each set containing five different runs as shown in table (3) .

In the first set at low temperature of 40oC and low concentration of acid 2wt. % the weight of dissolved copper alloy was found to be small and the weight loss due to corrosion decreased with the increase in concentration of inhibitor. In the second set at low temperature of 40oC and high concentration of 5.0wt. % the weight of dissolved copper alloy was found small and the weight loss decreased with the increase in concentration of inhibitor . In the third set at high temperature of 72 oC and low concentration of acid 2.0wt. % , the weight of dissolved copper alloy was found to be higher than the first and second sets and was decreased with increasing in inhibitor concentration . In the fourth set at high temperature of 72oC and high acid concentration 5.0wt. %, the weight of dissolved metal was found to be higher than the other sets and decreased with increase in inhibitor concentration.

Conclusions: 1. At static conditions by comparing the different inhibitor concentration, it was found that the minimum effective concentration was 0.1 wt.% Hexamine ,therefore this concentration was used throughout the rest experiments, since more than this concentration was not considerably better for protection of tubes and in order to have minimum cost . 2. At dynamic conditions from the results it was shown, that the higher temperature causes a decrease in inhibitor efficiency and also the increasing in inhibitor concentration above 0.1wt. % has small influence on decreasing the amount of dissolved copper alloy in citric acid solution 3.from whole tests results static and dynamic it was found

0.1wt.%Hexamine was the best concentration for protection and for corrosion inhibiting of the copper alloy tubes metal with acceptable cost , as above this concentration didn't improve the protection considerably ,these results agree with that of Eldrige ( 5 ).
