1. INTRODUCTION
Pulse Cathodic-Protection (PCP) systems were developed in response to a need for protecting closely spaced well casings [1-3]. Interference is an undesirable side effect of conventional CP system and it can be found in two forms, namely, stray current and mutual [35]. Interference is mainly governed by the soil resistivity and CP current level [4]. In the case of closely spaced well casings, the straycurrent interference occurs for unprotected structures or when their rectifiers fail. While the mutual interference occurs when two or more well casings are protected at different levels and/or have the same level but with different lengths. Interference adversely affects the distribution of CP along the well-casing axial length [5]. This may lead to a change in the slope of the potential profile to be opposite of that for the case without interference. As a result, this allows an increase in local cell action, i.e. accelerated corrosion rate. PCP is a unique CP device designed to provide protection from external corrosion of buried metal structures such as well casings and pipelines. The shape of the PCP current waveform has been described as "saw tooth". The output is given by discharging capacitors. The capacitors are charged up to 320V and the capacitance is variable from 0.15F to 5F. The rectifier can be adjusted from a frequency of 1000 to 5000 pulses per second, i.e. with a frequency range of 1-5kHz [1, 6-18]. 2

There are different hypotheses about PCP interference [15-18]. The width is controlled by adjusting the capacitance and frequency within

most two famous hypotheses that explain why PCP systems reduce interference are as the following. (a) Kinetic theory: the pulse duration is less than the time required for an oxidation reaction to occur. Consequently, a potential shift (interference) can be observed on neighboring structures, but this does not result in corrosion. (b) Skin effect theory: Because of the high frequency, the pulse currents travel along the outside surface of the conductors only and therefore have no effect on other structures in the electrolyte. Although, there exist other hypothetical explanations but unfortunately none of them has been clearly proven (or the proof has not been well documented). Some test results indicate that PCP systems do not reduce interference [15-18]. The CP current (DC) mitigates corrosion by electrochemically reducing any corrosive oxygen molecules and hydrogen ions that may be adsorbed on the surface of the structure in contact with the soil. As additional molecules and ions diffuse from the soil and become adsorbed onto the steel surface, they are also reduced by the continuously flowing direct current. There are certain drawbacks to conventional cathodic protection, however. Current flows in the ground continuously in a relatively large three dimensional envelope. If there are other foreign metallic structures buried in the soil within the current envelope, damage in terms of metal loss will very likely occur to the foreign structures. Also, the "throw", or distance down the pipeline or well casing that can be protected, is limited by the magnitude of the current reaching the more distant corroding surfaces. Test results of PCP to date have been conflicting and are subject to interpretation [1, 6-18]. The advantages of the pulse system have not 3

art The investigation reported in this paper is based on a state-of-thecommercial computer aided-design tool, CDEGS (Current Distribution, Electromagnetic Fields, Grounding and Soil Structure Analysis), which accommodates both the field and circuit-based model [19]. The CDEGS software package is a powerful set of integrated engineering software tools designed to accurately analyze problems involving grounding/earthing, electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic interference including AC/DC interference mitigation studies and various aspects of cathodic protection and anode bed analysis with a global perspective, starting literally from the ground up. It computes conductor currents and electromagnetic fields generated by an arbitrary network of energized conductors anywhere above or below ground for normal, fault, lightning and transient conditions. The interference levels can generally be calculated by using either a circuit approach or a field approach. The circuit approach usually offers more flexibility for long right-of-way shared by overhead transmission lines and pipelines. Thus in order to build a circuit model, a large number of line parameter calculations needs to be performed, which is a time consuming process. However, the predictions from the circuit approach are always conservative [20]. The filed approach, on the other hand, is based on numerical solution of all Maxwell's equations [21, 22]. Numerical evaluation (Gaussian integration method) of Sommerfeld integrals is used instead of an analytical approximation in order to get highly accurate results. This approach models the complete conductor network under consideration, in three-dimensional space and accommodates angled 4

conductors without making any approximations. The inductive,

conductive and capacitive coupling effects between all the elements in the network are simultaneously computed in one single step. The software utilized in our study is presented in references [21, 22]. detailed discussion of the computation methods employed by the

MALZ analyzes the frequency domain performance of buried conductor networks in the range from 0 to 1MHz and calculates the following quantities: earth and conductor potentials, longitudinal and leakage current distribution in the conductors, as well as magnetic fields in the air. This powerful grounding package is the ideal tool whenever coated conductors such no longer be approximated in a as equipotential horizontally, structures. spherically The or as pipelines need to be modeled and/or if the metallic conductors can conductors can be solid or hollow, coated or uncoated, and can be arbitrarily directed vertically,

In addition, MALZ can calculate the longitudinal (axial) and earth leakage (transversal) currents and potentials at each location in the grounding network (including return electrodes and metallic structures) [19].

combined and induced interference. Cathodic interference is more serious than its anodic fellow, since the current leaving the pipe/well casing close to the protected structure has a high current density, due to the localized anodic zone on the foreign structure. This foreign body only needs to be within the area of negative potential over a relatively short distance, for a severe concentrated corrosion to occur. In this paper, a study case has been investigated for the cathodic interference situation. Fig. 1 shows two parallel and equal-length vertical well casings spaced at 250m, where one is protected by a 5-m anode at 250m and the other is left unprotected. 5 There are four types of CP interferences, namely, anodic, cathodic,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Soil Resistivity

The distribution of CP on a well casing is affected by many factors as [4, 5]: (1) the geometry of the cathodic protection systems, (2) proximity of other conductors, (3) variations of soil resistivity, (4) the presence or absence of insulation on the casing, and (5) polarization of the casing surface. Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the waveforms of the total anode current and the well-casing segment current at 4m from the top of the well for different soil resistivities () due to square voltage wave pulse

Vmax = 100V, respectively. The field measurements [23] have shown
are DC with superimposed ripples having the same frequency of the 6

that all the recorded PCP currents through well casings and anodebeds

voltage pulses (3kHz). This is attributed to the inductive effect of the PCP current path which includes the feeding cables and the well casing itself. MATLAB simulation has shown a similar trend of the abovementioned current waveforms, where both the well casing and the connecting cables are simulated by a series resistance and inductance in the order of few ohms and few mH, respectively. These two values

highly depend on the well-casing length (few km) and the soil resistivity. In Fig. 2, it can be seen that there is a nonlinear decrease in with soil resistivity. Both the soil resistivity and polarization of the steel of well casings limit the magnitude of current produced by the PCP system and hence the stray current along the unprotected structure. For local-action cell on the surface of a metal, structures are in close proximity to each other; consequently, the soil resistivity is usually a secondary factor compared to the more important factor of polarization [24]. When the polarization occurs at the anode or at the cathode, it is said that the corrosion reaction is anodically or cathodically controlled, respectively. Therefore, the trend of the results in Fig. 2(a) is mainly attributed to the effect of steel polarization. The protection current at well-casing segment shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates that as the soil resistivity decreases the current pulses increase without swinging to positive values. This can be interpreted in terms of the time constant, where decreasing the soil resistivity gives lower resistance for the same inductance value, i.e. larger time constant. with depth (d) using PCP with square voltage wave pulse having f = that close to the rectifier/anode (top segments, e.g. at d = 4m and 28m) the current should appear as a series of pulses with the same frequency as the voltage pulse. As the distance from the 3kHz, W = 100s and Vmax = 100V and at  = 1  m. It can be noticed Fig. 3 shows the variation of the well-casing current waveforms the anode total current and the well-casing segment current at 4m

rectifier/anode increases, the pulse attenuates, the pulse width increases and the amplitude decreases (but the frequency remains constant). At some distance this attenuation will cause the pulsed 504m. Once the current becomes constant DC, it is not different than that from the conventional rectifiers. 7 current to become constant DC, e.g. those at e.g. at d = 204m and

a direct proportionality between the total anode average current and

the voltage-pulse frequency. From the comparison between Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) for the well-casing current at 4m and 108m from top, it can be concluded that the current density at the top of the well is much the current is lost to the top of the well, where pulses can be observed elsewhere but with significantly reduced magnitudes.

respectively. Both currents generally decay along the depth of each

layer. At the interface between any two layers when moving from high to low resistivities, the protection current increases, contrary to the stray current. The trend of these results is in accordance with the reasoning given in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 7(a) for multi-layer soil, moving longitudinally along the protected well-casing surface shows an increase in the protection current as a result of the decrease in the soil resistivity. On the contrary for single-layer low-resistivity soil (for  = 20 m), more even distribution of the protection current. In fact, the impressed current of the anode is the sum of the protection and the stray currents. As the soil resistivity decreases, higher protection current flows to the protected structure in the expense of decreasing the stray current. Consequently, more interference (stray current) can be expected in soil having high resistivity, see Fig. 7(b).

in other areas, see Figs. 8(a) and 8(b). Consequently, most of the current is lost to the top of the well. If pulsing the current can reduce the current density at the top of the well (compared to conventional current), a larger fraction of the total current would be available for areas on the well at greater depths. In this way, the pulsed current could be more effective than conventional CP current at depth, even though the current waveforms are similar at depth. In Fig. 8(a), it can 13

 = 5 and 100 m, respectively. Unused "abandoned" well casings
commonly exist in oil fields. Fig. 8(b) shows how the use of such unused well casing can improve the distribution of the CP current along the well casing and reduce the stray current on the unprotected m), in addition, the decay of these profiles becomes smoother than one as can be seen in Fig. 8(c). In Fig. 8(b) at high soil resistivity (100 those at  = 5 m. Therefore, the idea of utilizing unused well casings as anodes is very useful especially at low resistivities not only to get quasi-uniform distribution of the protection current but also to reduce the stray current interference with any nearby unprotected structure(s). The corrosive oxygen molecules and hydrogen ions, adsorbed on the surface of the buried structure, are electrochemically reduced within microseconds after the application of cathodic current. Before the corrosion reactions can begin again, additional molecules and ions must diffuse to the surface of the structure from the surrounding soil and become adsorbed. The diffusion and adsorption processes are orders of magnitude slower than the reduction process, particularly when the ions are not being driven by a continuously applied cathodic protection voltage. With PCP the corrosive molecules and ions are electrochemically reduced with very short duration but very high current pulses. Since throw is a function of current magnitude, the very high pulsed currents result in greatly improved throw down the length of the structure. Because of the natural electrical characteristics of the structure/anode system, the greatly improved high current throw is further enhanced by the inductive and capacitive redistribution of that current. Also, the very short duration pulses are separated by relatively long "off" intervals. The pulse voltage is applied for less than 20% of the total time [13]. Thus, the continuous current envelope and the resulting interference on foreign structures are greatly reduced. Consequently, it can be concluded that the use of PCP system roughly gives the same protection-current distribution but at reduced average current, where the latter depends on the soil 14

resistivity. On the other hand, at low soil resistivities, the use of

unused/abandoned well casing as an anode energized by the conventional CP system is a cost-effective method and gives quasiuniform distribution of the protection-current profiles with reducing structure(s). the average stray current interference along any nearby unprotected

Both the soil resistivity and polarization of the steel of well casings limit the magnitude of current produced by the CP system and hence the stray current along the unprotected structure. The soil resistivity is usually a secondary factor compared to the more important factor of polarization. The slower the voltage pulse waveform on rising and falling, the higher are the current amplitude of the anode and the wellcasing. In addition for a given peak value of the voltage pulses, there is a direct proportionality between the total anode average current and the voltage-pulse frequency For multi-layer soil, both the stray and the protection currents generally decay along the depth of each layer. At the interface between any two layers when moving from high to low resistivities, the protection current increases, contrary to the stray current. On most wells protected either by conventional CP or by the PCP systems, the current density at the top of the well is much greater than the current density in other areas. For the PCP, the current pulses can be observed on the top part of the well, while a completely smoothed current can be found elsewhere but with significantly reduced magnitudes. Utilizing unused well casings as anodes for nearby well casings together with the use of the conventional impressed pure DC CP gives a promising means for having a quasi-uniform distribution of length with low current-density requirement of the anode. the current-density profile along the protected well-casing axial
