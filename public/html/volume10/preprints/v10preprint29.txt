Abstarct Electropolishing is the method of obtaining extremely smooth surfaces. It is also observed that Electropolishing of stainless steel have enhanced localized corrosion resistance as compared to mechanically prepared surfaces. For biomedical applications such as orthopedic implants it is required that near zero defects surface is ensured .This work studies Electropolishing of solution annealed and cold rolled 316L stainless steel and characterizes the surface physically for roughness, topography and electrochemically for localized corrosion. Characterization techniques involve Profilometry, Specular reflection, SEM, AFM, Ellipsometry, XPS, polarization studies in Hank's solution, and Micro- cell Ecorr noise studies to estimate localized corrosion resistance. The results are compared with nitric acid passivated 316L stainless steel surfaces also. This part summarizes and discusses the results of characterization techniques like profilometry, specular reflection, SEM, AFM and ellipsometry.

1.Introduction Importance of Electropolishing is deeply studied by the researchers1-3. It can be brought out in brief as follows: To Achieve Bright, Smooth, Appealing surface, To remove strains, metal debris and embedded abrasives, enrichment in the surface, To decrease wear and fretting corrosion, To decrease the surface wettability, Improving texture, Finishing of complex geometries, etc. The surface roughness, texture and localized corrosion resistance are the most important characteristics for stabilizing tissue-implant interface. The proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells is hampered when corrosion products are released due to loss of passivity4. Nevertheless the Electropolished surface can hardly grow any germs over it5. To decrease the possibility of contamination of the surface, extreme smoothness is required (in the order of, RMS value equals to nanometer) as enhanced roughness may increase bacterial adhesion6. Also A rough bone implant surface is conceptualized7 as being built up of closely situated pits of different shapes and sizes. The parameters like `Pit effectivity expressing resistance towards shears and "Pit density factor" describing how densely packed the pits are being studied in depth to establish the relation between surface roughness and interfacial shear strength for bone anchored implants. Pits, cavities, and protrusions of similar size to proteins (1-10nm) and cells (1-100nm) can play an important role8. Growing cells respond to micro topography of the surface. Rougher surfaces were found to inhibit cell proliferation as well as give rise to more found to have considerably smooth surface and; showed significantly fewer

Enhancing the biocompatibility of the 316L stainless steel surfaces motivates us to characterize the electropolished surfaces and compare those with mechanically finished and nitric acid passivated surfaces.

Various annealed and cold rolled stainless steel 316L surfaces are subjected to optimized Electropolishing treatment9. To compare the results another set is nitric acid passivated10 also. These surfaces are observed for SEM, profilometry, specular reflection, AFM and ellipsometry. 2.Experimental 2.1 Sample Preparation 316L plate is cut in to 25mm*25mm squares with thickness ~ 3 mm. four types of bulk treatments are carried out namely; Solution anneal (Temp. ~ 10500C Soak time ~24 min Quench in water), 10%cold worked, 20%cold worked and 40%cold worked. All sample surfaces are cleaned and grit blasted to achieve 0.3 micron Ra value as a start roughness value. Two sets were prepared out of these treated samples; viz electropolished and mechanically buffed plus nitric acid passivated. Hence in all 8 types of samples were produced. Solution annealed and electropolished(SAEL), 10% cold rolled and electropolished(10EL) , 20% cold rolled and electropolished(20EL), 40% cold rolled and electropolished(40EL), Solution annealed and mechanically buffed plus nitric acid passivated(SABUFF), 10% cold rolled and mechanically buffed plus nitric acid passivated(10BUFF) , 20% cold rolled and mechanically buffed plus nitric acid passivated(20BUFF), 40% cold rolled and mechanically buffed plus nitric acid passivated(40BUFF).

Two surfaces appearing similar in optical brightness may differ in the smoothness of the surface. e.g. Solution annealed- Electropolished surface and 40% cold worked -Electropolished surface both showed specular 0.09 reflectance as 71-91% (Table1) but exhibited surface roughness (Ra () ) as and 0.14 / 0.08 respectively(Table2). Thus, it is obvious from the

results that only mirror bright surface does not ensure optically smooth surface especially when surface roughness becomes comparable with the wavelength of light.

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 10 Preprint 29 10 April 2007 electropolishing worked advantageously for the following reason: In roughened state the surface atoms are more active and this may lead to rapid dissolution reaction while Electropolishing. The phenomenon may be leading to quick formation of viscous compact layer, which may not be the case with mechanically smoothened surface. In fact, only mechanically buffed surface roughness of the surface may not be uniform, plastic deformation associated after Electropolishing becomes more deteriorated because The initial with mechanical buffing may not be uniform, thus lead to non-uniform dissolution during Electropolishing, lack of concentration gradients on the smooth surface may result in to relatively slow increase in metal ion concentration around the anode, and thus the establishment of the polishing conditions may require a longer time with a smooth surface than with a rougher surface. The roughness parameters denoted in Table2 viz. Ra, Rq, Rmax, and Rz are dependent upon .the several factors like Time of Electropolishing, Current density applied, Temperature, Air agitation, Stirring, and Initial surface roughness In case of Electropolished samples as degree of cold rolling increases the Ra value also increases, where as parameters like Rq, Rz, Rmax do not differ much. The smoothest surface is obtained in case of solution annealed, fine sand blasted and Electropolished sample. Buffed and nitric acid passivated samples do not show such trends. Ra value in vertical direction. i.e. in the direction of rolling ,is found lesser than in the horizontal direction in case of Electropolished samples.

Parameters like Rz and Rmax decide the presence of deep valleys over the surface which in turn decides the localized corrosion resistance. Therefore the controlled roughness shall be only that where these parameters are also minimized. 3.3 Scanning electron microscopy Solution annealed and Electropolished sample (Fig3) did not show any particular feature in SEM imaging (~2000X).where as irrespective of the treatment given to the samples; all the cold worked samples (Fig5, Fig6) showed the oriented features over the surface.

Atomic force images obtained reveal the existence of `nano roughness' and definite topography on all the Electropolished as well as buffed and nitric acid passivated surfaces. Solution annealed and Electropolished surface (Fig7) showed characteristic `diamond' shaped topographical feature equiaxed in orientation. The cell width is observed to be around 102 nm. The equiaxed distribution of "diamond shape" feature can be related to the uniform stress distribution over the surface where the applied voltage truly falls in the electropolishing zone of anodic polarization curve locally also. Whereas in all other cold worked-Electropolished (FI9, Fig10) and

mechanically buffed -nitric acid passivated sample(Fig 8), stripes are observed. These stripes cause ridges and furrows to exist on the surface. The material at the site of furrows is removed at a faster rate than at the ridge locations. This fact suggests the preferential attack over a certain planes. It is reported that11 densely packed planes(e.g.(111) in case of 316L stainless steel) being high energy planes ,undergo preferential electrochemical attack in the etching region of the anodic polarization curve, that in turn produces `stripes' on the surface.

As received stainless steel surface showed the thinnest passive chromia film (~50 A0) in ellipsometry studies(Table4). The subsequent treatment; either Electropolishing or nitric acid passivation enhances the thickness of the oxide film two to three times of the original. The postulated main mechanism of the growth of this film is anion migration (O-2 ) from the interface towards the bulk substrate material, after exposure to the ambient air12. In stainless steel electropolishing it is the preferential attack over iron which makes the surface more enriched in chromium .In electrochemical series gets converted in to Cr2O3 . i.e. passive film that spreads over the surface and protects the further dissolution of chromium. This fact supports the extra grown thickness of chromia in Electropolished samples . Nitric acid being strong oxidizing agent reacts vigorously with stainless steel surface and oxidizes it further to form the stronger chromia layer The ellipsometry results (Table4) show the highest thickness of chromia in least in (in treated samples) 40 % cold worked and Electropolished sample. According to Covino13 dissolved oxygen plays important role in the formation of passive film. Passive film requires a balance of film breakdown and film repair process. The repair process is supported by dissolved oxygen. Under deaerated conditions the thickness shows increase14. In the absence of sufficiently oxidizing conditions, a defective passive film is formed which

Electropolishing achieves surface smoothness in the order of nanometers, exploiting other benefits like textural evolution and chromium enrichment . All the eight samples exhibited different properties in terms of surface roughness, topographical features, thickness of passive film etc. Still all the surfaces appeared almost equally bright to the specular reflection studies. Only brightness may not ensure the surface smoothness when such a critical, vital application is considered where health and safety of the patient is of the prime concern. The roughness felt by profilometer can be called as `micro roughnesses. All resolution limit of the profilometer. It is very essential to describe the roughness in terms of Ra value (average general roughness value) as well as other parameters like Rq, Rz, Rmax which are more meaningful to assess the localized corrosion resistance behavior.

This `nano-roughness' shall prevent the `slippage' of the cells and may also give physical anchorage points. Moreover the peculiar texture imparted by Electropolishing shall also play an important role in the direction of proliferation of the growing cells over the implant surface. The equiaxed orientation observed only in solution annealed and Electropolished sample contact guidance to the growing cells that in turn forms the tissue encapsulation seal around the implant6 .This seal is responsible to act as a barrier layer for any corrosion products (if formed) from entering in to the vital system. The sole attempt should be given to minimize the spread of corrosion products in to the body which would cause some chronic disorder in the later period of life even when the implant is retrieved out. When an underlying surface has orientation in particular direction, cell growth may take place preferential in that direction resulting into the stronger and weaker patches in the soft tissue seal. Also an individual `diamond cell' observed in texture measures around 102 nm in width that matches with the size of cell and proteins involved in the formation of encapsulation. Ellipsometry data showed that Electropolished samples possess more thinner but reliable chromia than that of formed by the nitric acid passivation treatment where the probability of chromia passive film being impure is more. Any layer to be protective enough needs no extra thickness but it has to be compact, and well adherent to the substrate. More over thicker layer grows stresses within and looses integrity after a certain thickness. Hence thin, reliable oxide layers are preferred when corrosion protection is considered. A certain degree of cold rolling is definitely assisting in the formation of more corrosion resistant chromia film (which may not be thicker). Conventionally; cold rolled material being stressful should exhibit the worse corrosion properties. Although it is not surprising that these surfaces in Electropolished condition showed better corrosion resistance. In fact more the stresses present, higher shall be the rate of attack on surface while Electropolishing and hence more and more iron goes into solution enriching chromium level in the surface. This enriched chromium makes more consistent chromia film which can repassivate effectively after a corrosive attack. The decreased corrosion resistance of the material due to
