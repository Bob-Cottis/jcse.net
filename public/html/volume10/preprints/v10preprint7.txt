Abstract The high-temperature corrosion of three austenitic boiler steels with chlorine containing ash deposits, was experimentally tested under conditions simulating the super-heater of an oil shale boiler. The empirical kinetic equations were established for prediction of corrosion depth depending on operational time and temperature. The best corrosion resistance has been found for steel X8CrNiMoNb1616. Keywords: oil shale, boiler, super-heater, austenitic steel, corrosion Introduction In the firing process inorganic matter produces several chemically active compounds, notably potassium chloride [1], leading to both fouling and accelerated high-temperature corrosion in superheater and reheater tubes. Accelerated high temperature corrosion in the presence of chlorine has been a serious problem drawing considerable attention over the years. The problem was first encountered in coal firing boilers [2,3], later in waste incinerators [4] and recently biomass fired boilers developed as alternative energy sources [5-7]. Unfortunately, due to significant differences in (1) the combustion and fouling processes (2) the deposit chemistry and (3) deposit structure, it is virtually impossible to predict oil shale boiler corrosion rates from these prior results. A more precise prediction, based on conditions 1

High temperature corrosion of boiler steels subjected to oil shale ash has been under investigation at the Thermal Engineering Department of Tallinn University of Technology (TED TUT) over the last four decades [1]. The problem has persisted in that laboratory and industrial corrosion tests have not yet uncovered any "ideal" boiler steel capable of long term, elevated temperature operation in the presence of oil shale deposits. These investigations are being continued with the investigation of the following austenitic steels: B-407 (ASTM), X8CrNiNb1613 and X8CrNiMoNb1616 (DIN 17459). Corrosion Tests

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 10 Preprint 7 25 August 2006 The laboratory corrosion tests of boiler steels were conducted following established techniques [8, 9]. Combustion products from natural gas were directed into the furnaces (Fig. 1) by the pipe header and over electrically heated vertical tube-type furnaces having an inner diameter of 40 mm. To avoid condensation of water vapor the pipe header was heated by electrical an excess air ratio was maintained in the range of 1.25-1.30. The

heating coils. Natural gas was burned in a special combustion chamber where combustion gas velocity in the furnaces was about 0.15-0.18 m/s. According to gas analyses the content of O2 and CO2 in combustion products of natural gas was 4 % and 10 %, respectively.

Every furnace had an isothermal zone not less than 100 mm in length. The maintenance of constant temperature in the isothermal zones and associated temperature measurements were logged through analog control units and thermocouple sensors. During these experiments the temperature of the furnaces was maintained at levels of 540, 580 and 620° with an accuracy of ±2°.

As seen from equation (1), the corrosion process exponent is generally

proportional to the operating temperature of the metal. Regression lines of the 12Ch18N12T (Fig. 6) demonstrate this classical case with the following empirical equation: ln(S)= -8.12 - 297/T + (-0.84 + 0.00178·T)ln ; (St Err 0.34). (2)

A similar dependence was established by fitting the corrosion test data for B407 (solid lines in fig. 3). The regression equation in this case is:

ln(S)= -3.5 - 3077/T + (-1.11 + 0.00184·T)ln ; (St Err 0.3).

By comparison of equations (2) and (3) it could be noted that the relationship between the exponent of corrosion and the metal temperature is practically identical, i.e. the same slope, for both cases. The absolute value of the corrosion depth for B-407 is about the same as for 12Ch18N12T in the temperature range and tests duration 1000 h investigated (Fig 7). Assuming similar temperature dependences for the corrosion process

exponent, the following empirical equations, were established for prediction of corrosion depth of the steels X8CrNiNb1613 and X8CrNiMoNb1616, respectively:

ln(S)=6.0-620/T +(-1.12+1.810-3T)ln ; (St Err 0.188) ln(S)=-13.5+4027/T + (-0.97+1.810-3T)ln ; (St Err 0.194)
On the basis of established regression equations some predictions of

The corrosion resistance of 12Ch18N12T, -407, X8CrNiNb1613 after 1000 h of operation are projected to be similar. Steel X8CrNiMoNb1616 was found to have the least corrosion depth.

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 10 Preprint 7 25 August 2006 After 25000 h all of the steels except the steel 12Ch18N12T have practically the same corrosion resistance at 540°C. There are essential differences in steel is X8CrNiMoNb1616 - the worst is -407. At the same time the properties of the steels at higher temperatures. The best corrosion resistant corrosion depth of the steel B-407 at 620°C is 2 times less than the corrosion tests with a stable oxide scale under the layer of oil shale ash deposits;

depth of the steel 12Ch18N12T. These results were obtained by the corrosion however, the periodic destruction of the oxide scale that occurs in actual boiler operation has been previously found to sharply accelerate corrosion. Thus the final form of equation for prediction of the high temperature corrosion in the presence of oil shale ash could be established only after testing under actual operating conditions.

Conclusions 1. The empirical equations for prediction of corrosion depth of examined steels under stable layer of the oil shale ash deposits were established. 2. According to the laboratory corrosion tests the best corrosion resistant steel is X8CrNiMoNb1616. References 1 Ots A.
