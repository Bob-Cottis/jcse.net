ABSTRACT Elsyca CPMaster is a revolutionary 3D software tool for the design and optimisation of cathodic protection systems for burried and submerged structures. It provides the corrosion engineer an intelligent tool for managing operational costs, significantly reducing expensive commissioning surveys and costly repairs, adding major value to the cathodic protection business. Elsyca CPMaster is entirely integrated in SolidWorks® offering a user-friendly interface for the CP design, including file import from numerous other CAD packages. In this paper, Elsyca CPMaster simulations are compared to experimental data obtained by the Nederlandse Gasunie. The case that has been investigated is the interference between a cathodically protected underground storage tank (UST) and a concrete foundation. Experiments show that the protection level at the side of the UST near the concrete foundation is only ­600 to ­700 mV versus CSE, while the far field potential is about -1200 mV.

The interference can be mitigated by putting a PVC screen between the UST and the concrete fundation. This increases the protection level on the tank with about -200 mV at the foundation side, while the potential at the other side of the tank is hardly affected. The agreement between the experimental data obtained on site and Elsyca CPMaster simulations, using a two-layer model that accounts for the ground water level, is very good. Keywords: cathodic protection simulations, advanced software package, multi-layer model

Volume 9 Preprint 1 INTRODUCTION

6 February 2006

Cathodic Protection (CP) systems are widely applied to buried tank and pipeline structures, as they compensate (by electrochemical means) for the loss in physical protection due to the degradation of tank coatings over time. Most often, these CP systems contain a series of impressed current anode ground beds (though also sacrificial anodes can be used), placed at a remote distance from the pipes and tanks. The entire configuration of the CP system and the buried structures has some particular characteristics that necessitate and justify the use of numerical simulations.

First, the hidden character and low accessibility of these structures make installation, maintenance and repair very expensive. Also, the geometry of most steel structures that are subject to cathodic protection is too complex to allow analytical or even empirical estimations for the determination of the local protection level. Numerical modeling provides significant relieve by pointing out insufficiently protected regions - possibly subject to corrosion, and overprotected regions - subject to hydrogen evolution and hence coating delamination or hydrogen embrittlement. As a consequence, numerical modeling allows simplification and optimization of installation, maintenance and repair. Moreover, models provide reference values for measurements on operational sites, enabling to trace and solve any possible anomaly.

Most of the publications dealing with the computation of the CP of buried or submerged structures are based on the well known Boundary Element Method (BEM) [1]. Orazem et al. [2,3] use a 3D BEM approach to compute the protection level of large coating defects on pipelines. Results are presented for a pipe segment of limited length (10 feet), in presence of a parallel anode system. Riemer and Orazem [4] produced results for a larger pipeline (> 6 km)

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 9 Preprint 1 6 February 2006 with coating defects of varying size, and investigated the ability of coupons in the vicinity of the defects to measure off-potentials. Adey [5] applied a full 3D approach to calculate the potential field in the neighbourhood of jacket joints under cathodic protection of sacrificial anodes. The present authors [6] used a 3D coupled multi-domain BEM approach to simulate the protection level of a buried pipe segment surrounded by a U-shaped concrete vault.

The simulations presented in this paper are obtained using the Elsyca CPMaster software package [7] with fundamentals as decribed in the next section.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL Elsyca CPMaster is entirely integrated in SolidWorks® offering a user-friendly interface for the CP design, including file import from numerous other CAD packages. The mathematical model is based on the so-called Potential Model with key features are listed below:

· Parameterisation of all geometrical dimensions · Simulation of 3D CP-configurations with arbitrary complexity (including position and shape of ground beds, casings, ....) · Interference from 3rd party CP-systems · Ohmic drop effects in the soil or water · Anodic and cathodic reaction polarization behavior · Impressed current and sacrificial ground beds / anodes · Floating (not contacted) electrodes (for example casings) · Multi-layered soils with varying resistivity · Local metal dissolution calculation based on Faraday's law.

An automated hybrid grid generator is used to produce the high quality meshes that are required for the computations [9]. Full details can be found in reference [6].

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM The configuration of interest consists of a buried tank with concrete foundation (the latter assumed to be non-conducting) and part of steel reinforced concrete foundation of a neighbouring building (figure 1). The foundation is electrically connected to the CP system, hence exhibits a negative impact on the protection level of the tank surface. An insulating screen is installed between the tank and the foundation in order to limit the impact of the concrete foundation.

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 9 Preprint 1 6 February 2006 The tank has a diameter of 1.3 m, 4 m length and is positioned about 0.9 m below the earth surface (figure 2). For computational purposes, a sufficiently large box has been defined that surrounds the configuration of interest, the top plane coinciding with the earth surface and the side wall opposite to the tank being identified with the far field. Also a series of small cubes has been defined, representing possible positions of the reference electrode in perforated probe tubes. These small cubes are considered insulating, hence do not affect the current density distribution in the soil, they simply take the potential of the surrounding soil.

The value of L coat is not known a priori. It can be calculated from the fact that a current density j of -5.0E-6 A/m2 is needed [10] to obtain a minimum protection level V-U of ­850 mV vs CSE. As a result a value of L coat = 80.000  m2 is obtained. The curve presented by . equation (3) exhibits a linear behaviour due to the high value for the coating resistance.

Volume 9 Preprint 1 RESULTS

6 February 2006

Model with uniform resistivity The computational domain surrounding the tank and foundation is taken big enough in order to ensure that the side walls and bottom can be considered as "far field". The far field potential has been taken from measurements [11] and yields 1984 mV (average of two measurements (2011 and 1958 mV). The measured soil resistivity [11] is 780 .m (average value at different depths). The values for the resisitivity and characteristic thickness of the concrete around the rebar are tuned based on comparison between measured and simulated tank-to-soil potentials at the earth surface (situation with screen). Measured values for the tank-to-soil potentials [11] are about -700 mV (vs CSE) for the foundation side of the tank and about -1200 mV (vs CSE) for the far field side, as measured with respect to the perforated measurement tubes. This results in the following values:  = 10.000 .m and L = 10 cm. Results are presented con in Figure 3 for one of the trajectories for which data have been measured. The distance between the concrete foundation (left) and the far field (right) is 30 m.

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 9 Preprint 1 6 February 2006 The comparison between the simulated and measured potentials in the first meters around the foundation is very good. Away from the foundation however, discrepancies up to about 200 mV can be observed. It has to be said here that the current model assumes a uniform soil resistivity while in practise there is a second, less resistive, layer which will be accounted for later in this work. The actual protection level at the tank surface can easily be calculated as V ­ U. Since the metal potential V at the tank is 0 V, the protection level obtained is simply ­U. The simulated soil potential around the tank and at the reference points is presented in Figures 4 and 5. The average protection level at the foundation side of the tank increases with about 200 mV after introduction of the PVC screen, while at the other side the changes are much less pronounced. One can easily observe that the highest protection level at the far field side of the tank (not including tank foundation!) indeed is ­1200 mV (vs CSE), while at the foundation side of the tank, the protection level drops to about ­800 mV (vs CSE). A detailed comparison between the simulated and measured tank-to-soil potentials is presented in tabels 1 (far field side) and 2 (foundation side) for the situation with screen.

Important remark: From tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that the simulated tank-to-soil potential differ from the experimental values obtained in the reference points (`cubes"). This is partly due to the fact that the measuring tubes are located at some distance from the tank. From the simulations it can be observed that the potential of the reference points differs about 100 mV from the actual soil potential near the tank. This means that the measured value at the far field of the tank are too optimistic while at the other side of the tank, the values are too low .

Two-layer model In the previous section it has been observed that the simulated potential at the earth surface at larger distances from the foundation differed +/- 200 mV from the measured data (see Figure 3). This discrepancy in results is due to the fact that the soil resistivity has been assumed to be uniform. In this section, a two-layer model will be introduced. The top layer has a uniform soil resistivity with the same value as before (i.e. 780  The thickness and resistivity of the m).

The resistivity of the second layer allows to fit the potential near the concrete foundation while the starting depth of the grond water level allows to fit the potentials at larger distances. From this it turns out that a resistivity value for the second layer of about 150  starting m, from a depth of about 5 m, yields a very good agreement between the measured and simulated earth potentials over the complete trajectory (30 m in length).

ISSN 1466-8858 Volume 9 Preprint 1 6 February 2006 cathodic protection configuration (e.g. size and location of PVC screen, anode location, ...) in a fast and flexible manner.

Using the software package, the interference between a cathodically protected underground storage tank (UST) and a concrete foundation has been investigated. The resistivity of the concrete has been tuned such that the measured and simulated ground level potentials match. A first set of simulations, based on a uniform soil resistivity, predicts that the presence of a PVC screen between tank and foundation increases the protection level of the tank at the foundation side with about 150 to 200 mV. The measured and simulated values show a discrepancy of about 150 mV which already manifests itself in the far field region. This suggests the presence of a multi-layer soil with varying resistivity, coupled with the grond water level.

A second set of simulations based on a two layer model, with the second layer being much less resistive, shows very good agreement between the measured and simulated earth level potentials. Comparison between measured and simulated tank potentials suggests that the choosen values are close to the optimal combination for the start point and resistivity of the second layer.
