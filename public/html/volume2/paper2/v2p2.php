  The two main features of a protective coating are the adhesion and the
  anticorrosive protection. In order to improve both, chemical pre-treatments
  have been used. The use of chromate was very popular, but recently they have
  been highly restricted because of their toxicity, so that chromate-free
  pre-treatments have been developed and tested. An interesting alternative
  seems to be the deposition on the metallic surface of thin layers of zirconia
  by sol-gel process. In this study thin films of amorphous zirconia on low
  carbon steel sheets have been obtained by the dip-coating technique. The
  behaviour of the zirconia films as promoters of adhesion was evaluated
  measuring detachment of cross-scratched paint coated samples after Salt Fog
  Chamber Test. In addition, the determination of adhesion of organic coatings
  was performed by swelling in N-methyl pyrrolidone. According to the results,
  the samples pretreated by zirconia layers showed a good performance, in
  comparison with commercial chemical treatments (tricationic phosphate and iron
  phosphate). The protective properties of the zirconia films were found
  strongly depending on the process parameters, e.g. concentration of the
  precursors solutions and chelating agents, which rule the thickness and the
  organic residuals amount of the amorphous zirconia. In order to assess the
  behaviour of these sol-gel systems, preliminary tests using Electrochemical
  Impedance Spectroscopy were carried out too.

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  The most important properties of a protective coating are the anticorrosive
  action [1] and the adhesion to the substrate. The coatings act as barriers to
  aggressive chemical species, resulting also active against corrosion because
  of the chromate or phosphate present as pigments. However the coating
  protection fails, if the paint does not adhere to the substrate adequately [1,
  2]. At the aim of improving adhesion properties of organic coatings on steel,
  chemical pre-treatments have been used for a long. Among these chromate and
  phosphate pre-treatments showed to be quite useful. However, by law, many
  countries have forbidden the use of toxic pre-treatments (chromate-like), in
  spite of their good anticorrosive properties. Because of that, industry is
  deeply concerned about the development of a chemical process able to
  substitute chromate pre-treatments [3]. On steel it has been employed iron or
  zinc or tricationic (Zn, Mn, Fe) phosphate [4]. The use of phosphate has shown
  good results on galvanised steel. So, it improves the adhesion of the paint
  film and the anticorrosive protection. But phosphates are not the best option
  in ecological terms. Other chromate-free pre-treatments have been developed
  and tested. The choice of the chemical conversion treatment must be based on
  several criteria: economical, ecological, technical, etc. Some of them have a
  chromate-like behaviour, but are not economically attractive. The application
  of zirconium oxide as a pre-treatment on steel appears a promising compromise.
  On the other hand, ZrO<sub>2</sub>-CeO<sub>2 </sub>and other oxides films, put
  down on stainless steel by sol-gel techniques, resulted protective against dry
  and wet corrosion [5,6]. Sol-gel is a process to obtain films of metallic
  oxides in very mild conditions, but the reproducibility of thickness and the
  quality of them depend on several parameters affecting the precursors solution
  [7]. As an example the presence of complexing agent has already been shown to
  be important in improving the stability of solution of metal alkoxides, very
  moisture sensitive compounds [8-10]. In this study it was evaluated if the use
  of two different complexing reagents and the control of the hydrolysis allow
  the formation of ZrO<sub>2</sub> films suitable as pretreatments promoting
  adhesion of organic coatings. The zirconia applied by sol-gel on low carbon
  steel as an adhesion promoter instead of chromate and phosphate looks
  promising, however a technological application cannot disregard the evaluation
  of economical advantages.
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  Low carbon steel was used as substrate. 7.5cm x 10 cm samples were first
  degreased with organic solvents, then dipped into solutions of zirconium
  tetrabutoxide in anyhdrous butanol and withdrew at constant rate of 3 cm/s,
  obtaining thin films of amorphous zirconia. After the deposition, the film
  underwent thermal treatments in oven at temperature between 150-250�C, in
  order to densify and remove the most organic load. Repeating the deposition
  run, the thickness could be increased. The chelating agents employed in this
  study are acetic acid and acetylacetone, which have been selected based on
  previous study [8,9]. The hydrolysis and therefore the formation of the film
  was made by reacting in controlled humidity chamber (70% RH) after each
  dipping, except in series 7 and 8 where this step was made using boiling
  water. When the total thickness was obtained, the samples were treated at 150
  or 250�C In Table I are reported the concentration of precursor, chelating
  agent, number of layers, temperature and time of the thermal treatment. On
  comparison, the thickness of zirconia films on glasses, prepared in the same
  conditions was measured by using a profilometer Dektak 3 [6]. The value was
  around 0.60&mu;m, but for series 4 and 5 it
  increased up to about 1.0 &mu;m. The series
  9, 10 and 11 were used as reference samples. Degreased steel was coated in
  order to get a blank with poor adhesion between coating and substrate.
  Tricationic phosphate is a common chemical treatment, which highly improves
  the adhesion of the coating to the substrate as well as corrosion resistance.
  Iron phosphate has been studied because of its use on the industry due to low
  cost.&nbsp;

<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT>  <p>A multilayer polyester paint coating formed by a primer and a topcoat was
  applied in all cases. The average dry film thickness (DFT) was about 30 &mu;m.
  This kind of paint is usually used for electrical appliances [4]. A part of
  the coated samples were cross-scratched and tested evaluating the damage in
  Salt Fog Chamber (ASTM B117). In order to assess the adhesion promoted by the
  pre-treatment, quantitative measurements were made using a pull-off test
  (Sebastian IV) and measurements of the swelling of the film using N-methyl
  pyrrolidone [11]. The FTIR analyses were performed by a Spectrometer BioRad
  FTS 165, coupled with a BioRad UMA 250 device. In addition, Electrochemical
  Impedance Spectroscopy was used in order to monitor the increase in wet area
  and some other interfacial phenomena. A three-electrode cell was used,
  constituted by: Working electrode: Pre-treated and painted samples Counter
  electrode: Platinum sheet Reference electrode: Ag/AgCl (207 mV vs SHE) The
  electrolyte was 0.3%wt. Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, because of its
  characteristics of conductivity and low aggressiveness. The equipment used was
  a EG&amp;G PAR 273 potentiostat with a Schlumberger Solartron Frequency
  Response Analyser 1255. The results were registered with M398 software and
  treated with the EQUIVCRT software [12].</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Results and discussion</h3>
  The gel structure is determined from both the concentration of the alkoxides
  solution, and temperature or length of the thermal treatments. The hydrolysis
  and condensation of alkoxides of zirconium, similarly to those of other
  metallic species, easily take place in the solution, leading to a gel. This is
  constituted of an amorphous network of metallic oxide, even if discontinuous
  because of the presence of organic or hydroxylic functionalities. Being the
  hydrolysis of the alkoxides of zirconium faster than condensation, the gel
  could be formed slowing down the first reaction by adding complexing agent as
  acetylacetone or acetic acid. Moreover higher the molarity of alkoxide in the
  solution, higher the thickness of the deposited layers. The strength and the
  skeletal density of the gel as deposited improves after thermal treatment. The
  densification of the gel is accompanied by noticeable shrinkage, which could
  also cause cracks formation. During the heating, the most of the residuals
  further react leading to a more interconnected metallic oxide. In fact one of
  the advantages of using sol-gel process is the mild treatment necessary to
  form a ceramic layer. Anyway, a few organic residuals, especially the
  residuals deriving from the complexing substances, were always present in the
  film, unless the temperature of crystallization of the zirconia has been
  reached during the heating in air [10]. The IR spectra of all samples showed
  the presence of not reacted organic linked to the zirconia matrix. Increasing
  the maximum temperature from 150 to 250 �C the reduction of organic load is
  remarkable in the spectra of the samples 1 and 3 of Figure 1.

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT>  <h4>Salt Fog Chamber (First Part)&nbsp;</h4>
  <p>The results obtained in Salt Fog Chamber test are shown in Table II. The
  detachment near the scratch was measured by gently tearing off the disbonded
  area with a knife. In some cases blisters were also observed. The disbondment
  was not uniform along the cross scratch, so the data reported in the table are
  average values. In Table II also the maximum and the minimum were shown, when
  the range was too wide. These data evidenciated the adhesion properties of
  zirconia films depend on several parameters. Time and temperature of thermal
  treatment appear to be the most important of them. As discussed above, the
  heating promotes the reduction of organic load, so that the presence of a very
  few residuals seems to be advantageous to the adhesion. In order to maintain
  low the amount of organic residuals when the thickness of the films increases,
  the time or the temperature of the treatment have to be increased too. On the
  other hand, the zirconia prepared from solution containing the acetylacetone
  showed the worst behaviour among the sol-gel samples, even when they underwent
  the same thermal treatment. The stronger chelating action of acetylacetone
  with respect acid and its very difficult hydrolysis could account for these
  findings. The acetylacetonato groups bonded to zirconium prevent the
  condensation and the formation of an oxide network [11]. At the aim of to
  promote the hydrolysis, some of the samples were also hydrolysed in boiling
  acidic water, but the recorded improvement was too small and not sufficient to
  consider interesting the way. In fact that condition did not enhance the
  condensation accordingly, and the surface of the samples appeared dusty and
  not continuous, through observation with a stereoscopic microscope. Finally
  the microstructure of the samples obtained from solution containing the acid
  appeared more suitable to adhere to the organic coating.&nbsp;</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT>  <p>It is remarkable that the series 5 along with series 1 resulted the best in
  promoting adhesion. Moreover, the series 5 resulted even better than the other
  at longer time of analysis. The use of a more concentrated solution of
  alkoxide seems to be positive for a good performance of the zirconia film. At
  first glance this result could appear odd. Anyway the presence of a great
  number of residuals, in the film prepared from a concentrated solution, means
  they are closer than in a layer obtained from a diluted one. That
  configuration is likely more favourable to give condensation reactions,
  resulting a dense and thick metallic oxide layer. A ranking of the adhesion
  behaviour in Salt Spray Fog of our samples could be done. As regard the
  reference samples, those without pre-treatment resulted obviously not good at
  all. The use of iron phosphate as a pre-treatment shows good results in short
  times of exposure (7 days), compared with the zirconia film in series 1, 5 and
  2, but it is not a good option in long service life. Since now, tricationic
  phosphate looks the best option .</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Salt Fog Chamber Test (Second Part)</h3>
  <p>The results previous discussed brought about the further study was
  restricted to samples of series 1 and 5. Different sheet were coated by
  zirconia and another polyester paint system (also used on domestic electric
  appliences). Moreover, in order to prove without any doubt the effect of the
  heat treatment, other samples have also been prepared, the features of which
  are reported in Table III, along with the results of Salt Fog Chamber test.
  The results were even better than those expected. All the samples with sol-gel
  films applied and hydrolysed without the thermal treatment showed a
  significant detachment in short-time exposure. Besides of the effect of the
  new paint, it is noteworthy the better performance of the sol-gel
  pre-treatment with respect the iron phosphate, even though not as good as the
  tricationic posphate. Moreover the behaviour of these new series maintains
  very good also after large time of exposure in Salt Fog Spray. The results of
  the test of reference samples had shown once more how important is the
  pre-treatment of the steel in promoting adhesion. The low corrosion and the
  negligible blistering phenomenon observed for the samples 5&quot; and 5 proved
  the reactions of condensation take place fastly in a concentrated solution. So
  that a thicker and stiffer layer of gel could be obtained from those
  solutions, which can take more advantage from the thermal treatment already at
  low temperature.&nbsp;</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT>  <h4>Swelling with N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP)</h4>
  <p>Van Ooij et al [7] have proposed the measure of the adhesion of the paint
  coating on the base of its swelling in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). In fact the
  swelling produces stress, which could detach the paint from substrate. This
  test of adhesion of a film to metal depends on the thickness of film, the
  nature of the coating, and especially the pre-treatment on substrate surface.
  The results of this test are expressed as time of total detachment of the
  organic film in NMP. This parameter is named NMPRT (N-methyl pyrrolidone
  retention time). The test is based on the hypothesis that NMP acts on organic
  coating, disregarding substrate and pre-treatment. Actually the presence of
  organic residuals in the zirconia films of this study, even if negligible,
  could invalidate the assumption, so that the detachment could be due both to
  the stresses induced by swelling and a chemical-physical interaction between
  NMP and the zirconia films. In order to clarify this effect FTIR analyses on
  unpainted samples, before and after the immersion in NMP at 60�C, have been
  performed. In some cases (series 1) the organic residual part in the zirconia
  thin film was highly removed (Figure 2) by NMP, but in the series 5, the
  difference were not detectable before and after immersion (Figure 3), probably
  due to the greater thickness of these samples. It can also evidenciated the
  presence of the NMP adsorbed on the films, from a signal at about 1700 cm-1
  referring to C=O bonds. So, it seems that the remotion of the organic
  components of the zirconia thin film by the NMP affects the results of this
  test.</p>

  <p>There was no total detachment of the coating on the samples pre-treated
  with phosphate, but after 2 hours we could appreciate the formation of
  blisters reaching a 4M and 7M degree (according to ASTM D 714), for the iron
  and tricationic phosphates, respectively. Anyway the results showed again that
  the zirconia films, even if are not as good as tricationic phosphate, are
  better than the degreased steel.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT>  <h4>Pull-off test</h4>
  <p>The tests carried out with a pull-off device (Sebastian IV) have not been
  useful in this research, because of the type of failure. The failure mode was
  decohesive in the topcoat, and we did not see the primer. As a result we just
  can say that the mechanical features of the coating are poor or inferior to
  the substrate adhesion.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT>  <h4>Impedance measurements</h4>
  <p>Impedance measurements were performed in order to follow the progressive
  loss of adhesion between the coating and the pretreatment or substrate.
  Because of the high quality of the organic paint, for all the samples only a
  capacitive behaviour could be recorded, so that the coating system do not
  allow us to evaluate the differences existing among the pre-treatments. At the
  aim of overtaking the impasse, some defects have been introduced on the
  organic coating by using a metallic pin. The size of the defects was almost
  the same in all samples (&asymp;150 &mu;m
  diameter), according to the measurements through microscopical observations.
  That value was also confirmed by the analyses of the first loop in the
  impedance diagrams (Figure 4), which allow to determine the area of the
  defect. Generally the whole Nyquist diagrams show two semicircles at the
  beginning of the experiment, and a third one after few hours (Figure 5). The
  fitting of the impedance results was performed by Equivcrt software [9]. In
  the high frequency semicircle, the simulation have yielded values, which could
  be associated with the properties of the coating as well as the size of the
  defect. Anyway in absence of a model, the interpretation of the rest of the
  diagram is not easy and still in progress. As an example, the semicircle with
  a maximum frequency at 3.9 Hz in Figure 5 can be deconvolved in two
  components. Provoking larger defects (300 &mu;m) on
  the coated surface, the impedance diagrams became simpler, comparing same
  period (Figure 6). It can be assumed the presence of corrosion products
  occludes the defect when it is small, hiding the progress of the detachment of
  the coating. Nevertheless, increasing the size of defect moves the response
  due to the coating out of the experimental frequency window. As a a
  consequence the size of the defect was shown a relevant and important
  parameter in the corrosion processes and further efforts have to be addressed
  to explain both small and large defects affect impedance response.&nbsp;</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  On the base of these results, it is easy to infer that thin amorphous zirconia
  films are better pre-treatment than a commercial iron phosphate, even if they
  are not so good as the tricationic one. Also, the thermal treatment on forming
  the zirconia film is important and a very strict control in the use of
  temperature and time of treatment is a condition in order to obtain the best
  performance on adhesion of the ZrO<sub>2</sub> film. The N-methyl pyrrolidone
  test for the assessment of the adhesion between organic coating and substrate
  cannot provide indisputable results because of its interaction with the
  organic component still present in the studied zirconia thin film.
