<h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was compared with the conventional
  testing regime for examining the resistance to attack by artificial
  perspiration of a number of water based finishing lacquers. The lacquers were
  used as finishing treatments for lacquer coated steel shopping trolleys. EIS
  was found to be superior to the conventional regime (exposure followed by
  abrasion). EIS was able to provide quantitative data about the degradation
  process, whereas the conventional regime could only provide a pass/fail
  result. EIS was also able to differentiate between the performance of
  different lacquers capable of obtaining a pass result in the conventional
  test.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>Resistance to perspiration exposure is especially important for items
  fabricated with the requirement of being physically handled. A prime example
  is shopping trolleys. In Britain, shopping trolleys are usually constructed of
  lacquer coated zinc electroplated steel. The lacquer used is usually
  colourless, transparent and approximately 5<font face="Symbol">m</font> m
  thickness. One of the largest problems associated with this product is
  discoloration and zinc loss of the handles and top rail. This leads to an
  unattractive dull grey/black appearance, as opposed to the initial bright
  metallic finish. In today&#146;s world, maintaining the appearance of the product
  can be as important as maintaining its function.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>One testing method used to examine this problem is exposure to artificial
  perspiration. Examples are the ANSI artificial perspiration test[1] for
  coating degradation, and the Volvo leaching test[2] for chromate loss from
  surfaces. This article describes the use of electrical impedance spectroscopy
  (EIS)[3,4,5] to support conventional artificial perspiration exposure testing.
  The substrate examined is zinc electroplated steel coated with a variety of
  thin water based finishing lacquers.</p>
  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Three lacquer systems are discussed. These are representative of the
  different responses obtained from a number of water based finishing lacquers
  from a variety of sources. The lacquers have been designated as A, Band C.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>Samples of lacquer coated zinc electroplated steel (samples taken from
  shopping trolleys in the vicinity of the top rail/handle or testing panels of
  dimensions 6cm by 10cm) were examined using the ANSI artificial perspiration
  exposure test[1]. This consists of exposing the samples to synthetic
  perspiration for four 15 minute cycles, with hardness testing of the lacquer
  coating by abrasion with a 2B pencil (prepared as described in the standard)
  after each exposure cycle. If the coating can be removed, this is defined as a
  test failure. The cycle after which the failure occurred is also noted. The
  formulation of the ANSI artificial perspiration solution is given in Table 1.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>Samples were also examined using EIS spectroscopy, with testing undertaken
  after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exposure. The samples were abraded
  using a 2B pencil after each 15 minute exposure period, before EIS
  measurements were taken. The instrument used was a single channel ACM autoAC
  DSP (1996 model). The frequency range examined was 30 KHz to 0.1 Hz., and the
  potential perturbation used was <font face="Symbol">�</font> 10mV around the
  rest potential.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>The high frequency coating response was determined from a Nyquist
  plot[3,4,5], and the coating resistance calculated. All samples were examined
  in triplicate. Values varied within each sample group by up to <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  30% with respect to the mean value.</p>
  <h3>Results</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>The results of the conventional test are given in Table 2. The thin and
  colourless nature of the lacquer coatings made it extremely difficult to
  visually determine the failure point of the test.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 1 is an example of the Nyquist response obtained from lacquer C
  after 60 minutes of exposure. The high frequency coating response is clearly
  differentiated from the lower frequency response associated with the charge
  transfer processes associated with substrate corrosion[3,4,5].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 2 shows the coating response of zinc electroplated steel coated with
  the three lacquers, A, B and C. Lacquer A shows no degradation during the
  test. Lacquer B shows no penetration over the time period of the test, but
  clearly shows coating degradation. Lacquer C shows a sudden drop in coating
  resistance during the test, indicative of penetration of the pencil through to
  the metallic substrate.</p>
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 1 shows an example of an EIS Nyquist response obtained from lacquer
  C after 60 minutes of exposure. The response covers the frequency range of
  30KHz down to 1Hz. Two semicircles are clearly visible. The high frequency
  semicircle, with Z imaginary max occurring at a value of about 10,000Hz, can
  be attributed to the response of the lacquer coating[3,4,5]. The lower
  frequency circle, with Z imaginary max at about 100Hz, can be attributed to
  the corrosion of the substrate, presumably the zinc electroplate film. A value
  for the coating resistance can be calculated from the first semicircle.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>From the coating resistance EIS results presented in Figure 2, it can be
  noted that the three lacquer coatings discussed here produce different modes
  of behaviour. As stated previously, these are typical examples from a larger
  group of lacquers. The three modes of behaviour are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>1. Lacquers showing little or no degradation (reduction in coating
      resistance) with exposure time. This is shown by lacquer A, where little
      or no decline from the initial coating resistance of about 4000<font face="Symbol">W</font>.cm<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li>Lacquers showing a steady decline in coating resistance with exposure,
      but no sharp drop to a very low value. This is shown by lacquer B, where a
      decline in coating resistance from 2000<font face="Symbol"> W</font>.cm<sup>2</sup>
      to approximately 450<font face="Symbol"> W</font>.cm<sup>2</sup> is
      observed. The environment is progressively degrading the coating,
      indicating that the coating would be unsuitable for use in conditions
      where contact with perspiration would occur. However, no penetration of
      the 2B pencil through to the substrate occurred, and the lacquer would
      have passed the standardised conventional test.</li>
    <li>Lacquers which show a rapid decline in coating resistance to a value
      below 100<font face="Symbol"> W</font>.cm<sup>2 </sup>after a given period
      of exposure, associated with coating degradation, and penetration of the
      2B pencil through to the substrate. An example is lacquer C. After 45
      minutes of exposure a significant decline in coating resistance can be
      observed. This is followed by a fall to less than 100<font face="Symbol">
      W</font>.cm<sup>2</sup> after 60 minutes of exposure as the 2B pencil
      penetrates through the lacquer coating.</li>
  </ol>
  <SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>Examining the conventional test results (Table 2), it can be noted that
  there are substantial problems associated with using this test to examine thin
  colourless transparent finishing lacquers. The first problem is that the test
  failure definition is based on the visual observation of coating removal. We
  have found that with the lacquer types examined it was usually impossible to
  detect this. Secondly, the test regime is a pass/fail test. It is not
  generally possible to differentiate between different &quot;pass&quot;
  coatings. Finally, the test is a qualitative test, in that a judgement of
  coating softening is entirely dependant on the person undertaking the test as
  they abrade the coating with the 2B pencil.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>The use of EIS as a supporting technique provides substantial advantages. A
  failure, associated with penetration of the 2B pencil through to the metal
  substrate is immediately apparent, with the coating resistance dropping to a
  low level, usually less than 100<font face="Symbol">W</font>.cm<sup>2</sup>.
  This can be seen in Figure 2, for lacquer C after 60 minutes of exposure. The
  second advantage over the conventional technique is that it enables
  differentiation between coatings that would be defined as passing the
  conventional test. The conventional test could not differentiate between
  lacquers A and B. However, EIS can clearly show that lacquer A has a lower
  initial porosity (higher initial coating resistance) than B. Also, lacquer B
  degrades over the lifetime of the test, whereas lacquer A does not.</p>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>EIS is a useful supporting technique for use with artificial
      perspiration testing.<br>
    </li>
    <li>EIS was better able to determine the failure point of the test, in
      comparison to the conventional testing regime.<br>
    </li>
    <li>EIS was able to differentiate between different lacquer coatings that
      would be defined as passing the artificial perspiration exposure test.
      Both the initial porosity and the resistance to degradation of the coating
      could be determined quantitatively.</li>
