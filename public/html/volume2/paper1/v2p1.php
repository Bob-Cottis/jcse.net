  Filiform corrosion tests to BS X 32: 1991 were performed on 3XXX series
  aluminium alloys to study the effectiveness of various cleaning methods and
  chromating treatments and the influence of grain structure, surface topography
  and chloride contamination. The filiform susceptibility was shown to be more
  closely related to the surface condition than to the substrate microstructure
  and those treatments that removed the original mill finished surface layer
  were found to be the most effective. The behaviour of the chromate treated
  panels was only slightly affected by the thickness of the conversion coatings
  and similar resistance could be achieved by an alternative treatment in an
  appropriate alkaline cleaner together with mechanical or electrochemical
  polishing. The greatest reduction in filament growth was achieved by
  electropolishing, due both to the efficient removal of contamination and the
  freedom from surface irregularities that enhance filament growth in the
  rolling direction.&nbsp;

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  Filiform corrosion is a localised form of attack that can occur beneath paint
  films and leads to the appearance of thread-like filaments. It is usually
  considered to result from surface contamination and will only propagate in
  humid conditions [1]. The process initiates when water reaches the contaminant
  and hydrolysis of these salts results in lowering of the local pH. Filiform
  corrosion is an example of a differential aeration cell. Oxygen diffuses
  towards the tip of the filament and is reduced at cathodic sites [2]. This
  causes a rise in the pH in these regions causing corrosion products to be
  precipitated at the sides of the filament and stifling further growth. The
  effect is that corrosion continues only at the anodic tip and the filament
  develops in this direction alone. A further factor contributing to the problem
  is that the high pH is believed to be damaging to paint films, promoting
  cathodic disbondment. In addition, the voluminous corrosion products may cause
  stresses which lift the coating and assist propagation [3]. The nature of the
  chemical pretreatment used prior to painting has a very important influence on
  the subsequent occurrence of filiform corrosion [4,5]. Chromate containing
  pretreatments have been widely used commercially, although alternatives are
  being actively sought on health and environmental grounds. A considerable
  range of susceptibility can be displayed between different alloys [6]. It has
  been unclear whether this range of behaviour is caused by differences in the
  alloy compositions or by their particular microstructures or surface condition
  [7]. In the work described in this paper the individual factors that influence
  an alloyï¿½s susceptibility to filiform corrosion have been studied in detail.
  In particular, the effects of various cleaning methods and chromating
  treatments have been investigated, together with the influence of surface
  contamination, grain structure and mechanical and electrochemical polishing.

<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Surface treatments </u>Panels 145 mm x 80 mm of the mill finished alloys
  were prepared using a variety of cleaning and pretreatment methods. The
  standard pretreatment was [1] Clean in acetone [2] Alkaline clean in Ridoline
  1806 (30s) [3] Rinse in tap water [4] Acid rinse in 23% HNO<sub>3</sub> (15s)
  [5] Distilled water rinse. The influence of each experimental variable was
  investigated separately by omitting or adding steps in the standard treatment
  as shown in Table 2. For example, some panels were prepared by cleaning in
  acetone alone and others had the additional step of cleaning in 1M NaOH. The
  effects of different chromating treatments were investigated by varying the
  time of exposure to the Alochrom bath. In general, two replicate specimens
  were produced for each condition. The panels were painted by bar coating with
  3-5 microns of polyester primer, dried for 2 hours at 60&deg;C and then given 13-15
  microns of polyester top coat and dried for 10 hours at 50&deg;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Filiform corrosion testing</u> The painted panels were tested using the
  standard filiform method BS X 32: 1991. A scribe 2mm wide and 0.15 mm deep was
  produced in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Filiform corrosion was
  initiated by exposure to HCl vapour for 1 hour and the panels were then tested
  at 42&deg;C and 82% RH for 1000 hours. The extent of filiform corrosion was
  quantitatively assessed by measuring the lengths and areas of the filaments
  that developed on each scribe using a Leica 500QMC image analyser.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
  The appearance of the filiform corrosion that developed on the non-chromated
  panels is shown in Fig 1. In each case, the filaments grew more rapidly on the
  transverse scribe and propagated in the direction of the irregularities on the
  rolled surface. After long exposure times the filaments slowed down and
  eventually stopped growing as shown in Fig 2. This behaviour suggests that the
  filaments develop by a mechanism that involves oxygen diffusion along the
  length of the filament to a cathode region just behind the growing anodic
  head. This process becomes more difficult as the length increases and as the
  corrosion product dries out.&nbsp;

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT>  <p align="center">&nbsp; <b>Fig 2. Comparison of filament growth rates on
  chromated panels&nbsp;</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT>  <p>It was found that the most useful measure of the extent of filiform
  corrosion was the total length of the filaments that developed on the 70 mm
  long scribe during the 1000 hours exposure. In each case, these total lengths
  were expressed as Relative Filament Lengths (%) by comparing them with those
  that formed on 3003A when tested in the painted mill finish condition, without
  any form of pretreatment. The filament lengths were consistent between the two
  replicate panels, being within 15% of each other in all cases and within 10%
  on panels that had been chromated.&nbsp;</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>General effect of commercial cleaning and chromating treatments </u>Fig
  3 shows the effect of each step in the pretreatment process on the lengths of
  the filaments that formed on 3003A. The commercial alkaline cleaner Ridoline
  1806 removes some aluminium from the surface and this is seen to be more
  effective than cleaning with acetone alone. A further reduction in filament
  length occurred when the surface was chromated. It is interesting to note the
  extent of this improvement when it is considered that the conversion coating
  is discontinuous [8] as shown in the TEM micrograph in Fig 4.</p>

  <p><u>Cleaning treatments </u>The effectiveness of the different cleaning
  treatments for each of the alloys can be seen in more detail in Fig 5.
  Cleaning in Ridoline for 30s removed 5-10 nm of aluminium from the surface. In
  contrast, the additional step of cleaning for 20s in 1M NaOH solution removed
  a thickness of approximately 200 nm and this resulted in reduced relative
  filament lengths.</p>

  methods&nbsp;</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Chromating time </u>In each case, longer chromating times slightly
  reduced the extent of filiform corrosion as shown in Fig 6. This is assumed to
  result from the accompanying increase in the thicknesses of the chromate
  conversion coatings with treatment time. The chromating times of 45, 90 and
  180s corresponded to coating thicknesses of approximately 60, 120 and 230 nm,
  respectively. These treatment times were considerably longer than those used
  commercially, where catalysts are added to the bath and where the time
  required to produce a 60 nm coating is typically in the order of 5 seconds.
  Even the thicker coatings were nodular in appearance and the discontinuities
  are sites at which corrosion initiation will occur. It is believed that the
  effectiveness of chromating is due, in part, to the improved paint adhesion.

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT>  <p align="center"><b>Fig 6. Comparison of the effects of different chromating
  and Cr VI rinse times</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT>  <p>Chromating is usually followed by a chromium VI rinse and this gave a
  further small reduction in the filament lengths. It is probable that some
  residual Cr VI remains on the surface after the rinse and that this acts as a
  corrosion inhibitor, although it was not possible to detect its presence in
  this study. Further reduction of chromium during rinsing would improve the
  properties of the conversion coating but this reaction is believed to be slow
  and the use of the chromium VI rinse on non-chromated panels only reduced the
  filament lengths by 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Effect of surface contamination </u>The influence of surface
  contamination was investigated by applying tracks of NaCl solution to
  pretreated panels prior to painting. The relative filament lengths that
  developed on contaminated and non-contaminated regions of chromated alloys are
  compared in Fig 7. Similar increases in filament lengths occurred on panels
  that had been mechanically abraded but not pretreated.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT>  <p align="center"><b>Fig 7. Influence of NaCl contamination on the filament
  lengths on chromated panels</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT>  <p>Dissolved salts have an important effect on film breakdown in aluminium
  alloys and they are known to concentrate in localised corrosion cells, yet the
  increase in filament growth resulting from deliberate chloride contamination
  was surprisingly small. This could be related to the way that the filiform
  corrosion test was performed in that a high concentration of chloride was also
  deposited on the surface of the scribe during exposure to HCl vapour in the
  initiation stage. It was shown that increasing the initiation time caused
  longer relative filament lengths due to the higher concentration of salt
  deposited.&nbsp;</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Effect of surface polishing </u>It is known that filaments tend to
  follow the surface irregularities introduced by the rolling process (typically
  5 &mu;m deep ) and that there is little development
  of filaments in the transverse direction [6]. For this reason, it was expected
  that the extent of filiform corrosion would be affected by polishing the
  surface with different grades of silicon carbide papers. Fig 8 shows the
  relative filament lengths for non-chromated panels that had been polished with
  320 grit (45 &mu;m), 800 grit (22 &mu;m) and 4000 grit (5 &mu;m) papers. The finer
  polishing had a beneficial effect in reducing the filament length and these
  results appear to support the view that filiform corrosion is enhanced by
  surface topography.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT>  <p align="center"><b>Fig 8. Effect of mechanical polishing using different
  sizes of abrasive particles</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT>  <p>Although the corrosion filaments (typically 70 &mu;m 
  diameter) are larger than the surface irregularities [6,9], it is likely
  that the occluded cell at the head of the filament can propagate more easily
  along the irregularities and finer polishing would have the effect of reducing
  these pre-existing corrosion paths. This point was examined further by
  electropolishing the surface to remove all grinding and rolling marks and the
  results of these tests are discussed later. An alternative explanation for the
  effect of surface topography on the mill finished panels is that paint
  adhesion may be poorer at the bottom of the rolling marks. This could be the
  result of inadequate cleaning, particularly where rolling lubricant has been
  incorporated into the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Effect of polishing direction </u>A further possible explanation for
  filiform corrosion following the rolling direction more easily than the
  transverse direction is because it is affected by the elongated microstructure
  of the substrate rather than by the surface topography. (The aspect ratios of
  the grains in the three materials are shown in Table 3.) This possibility was
  examined by testing panels in which different areas had been polished in
  either the longitudinal or the transverse directions. It was shown that the
  filaments followed the direction of the polishing marks rather than that of
  the elongated grains and the relative filament lengths were the same in each
  case. The results indicate that the directional filiform growth is caused by
  characteristics of the surface layer rather than by the properties of the
  substrate microstructure [10].<br>

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Effect of substrate recrystallisation </u>The above conclusion was
  confirmed by conducting tests in which panels were recrystallised by heat
  treatment at 535&deg;C prior to abrading down to 4000 grit paper (5 &mu;m 
  particle size), followed by painting. The results in Fig 9 show that the
  same relative filament length occurred in as-received and recrystallised
  material, again indicating that filiform corrosion was not controlled by the
  substrate grain shape.&nbsp;</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(29)</SCRIPT>  <p><u>Effect of electropolishing </u>The smallest relative filament lengths
  from all the tests occurred on panels that were electropolished. The results
  for non-chromated 3003B are shown in Fig 9. There was only a small difference
  between the results of tests on as-received and recrystallised material.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT>  <p align="center"><b>Fig 9. Effect of recrystallisation and electropolishing
  on non-chromated 3003B</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT>  <p>It appears that the excellent performance of the electropolished surface
  could be attributed in part to the reduction in surface roughness. A further
  consideration is that each stage in polishing not only reduces the
  irregularities but it also involves the removal of more of the surface. The
  electropolished panels, which were the least susceptible to filiform
  corrosion, had more material removed during preparation. In a similar way,
  sequential mechanical polishing (45 &mu;m - 22 &mu;m - 5 &mu;m), 
  that was shown in Fig 8 to reduce the
  relative filament lengths, also required removing successively more material.
  However, the mechanical and electropolishing treatments removed approximately
  100 &mu;m and 200 &mu;m,
  respectively. This was considerably greater than the depth of the original
  surface layer and it is clear that all of the polished surfaces would have
  been free of high temperature oxide films, impressed rolling lubricant and
  other sources of contamination arising from processing. It is considered that
  it was the removal of the surface layer and the resulting freedom from
  contamination that produced the greatest contribution to the improvement in
  filiform corrosion resistance but there were additional benefits in
  controlling filiform corrosion by polishing to reduce the surface
  irregularities. The effects of all the cleaning and pretreatments are
  summarised in Table 4.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <ol>
<SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT>    <li>The filiform corrosion susceptibility of aluminium sheet was shown to be
      more closely related to the condition of the original surface layer than
      to the microstructure of the substrate. This was due to the presence on
      the surface of high temperature oxides, rolling lubricants and other
      contaminants from processing.&nbsp;</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(35)</SCRIPT>    <li>Solvent cleaning of the aluminium prior to painting could reduce some of
      the subsequent development of corrosion filaments but those treatments
      that removed the original mill finished surface layer were found to be
      more effective.&nbsp;</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(36)</SCRIPT>    <li>The use of appropriate alkaline cleaning, together with mechanical or
      electrochemical polishing, was able to control filiform corrosion to a
      similar extent to a chromate conversion coating.&nbsp;</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(37)</SCRIPT>    <li>Electropolishing the surface gave the greatest reduction in filament
      development. This was attributed both to the efficient removal of the
      surface layer and to the production of a microscopically flat surface,
      free from the polishing irregularities that promote filiform corrosion.</li>
