Abstract 
Friction  stir-welding  has  become  widely  practiced  in  the  fabrication  of  light-weight 
structures requiring high strength-to-weight ratios and superior corrosion resistance. The 
friction stir-welding (FSW) process and tool parameters play a key role in determining the 
√ìRLQP¬∑V ≈ÉOMUM≈ÉPHULVPL≈ÉVB HQ POLV SMSHU Copper-copper and brass-brass plates were welded 
using friction stir welding machine at same rotational and transverse speeds. The corrosion 
resistance behavior of friction stir-welded copper-copper and brass-brass joints along with 
parent copper and brass plates were studied via polarization and weight loss method. The 
microstructures  were  examined to  observe  corrosion  resistance.  Energy  Dispersive 
Spectroscopy was  conducted  to  know  elemental  composition  of parent  metals. Optical 
microscope was used to obtain the microstructures of parent, welded and corroded plates. 
The  experimental  results  indicated  that  the  welding  process  has  a  major  effect  on  the 
corrosion  resistance,  as the  weld  joint  acts  as  a  cathode  and  gives  better  resistance  to 
corrosion when compared to parent plates.  
  
Key words: Friction stir welding, corrosion, polarization, Hardness, microstructure. 
 
Introduction 
Friction  stir  welding  is  one  of  the  solid  state  welding  processes  which  has  gained 
enormous interest in present day research as it involves a welding process produced by 
softening, plastic deformation combined with forging action caused by tool rotation of base 
metal [1-4]. Absence of melting of base metal in FSW reduces oxidation, residual stress, 
solidification  related  defects.  In  recent  times  many  reports  on  friction  stir  welding  of 
various  metal  system  such  as  aluminium  [5-9],  magnesium  [10,  11],  mild  steel  [12], 
stainless steel [13] have been published.  
Welding  of  copper  is  usually  difficult  by  conventional  fusion  techniques  due  to  the 
deteriorative influence of oxygen, impurities and also because of its high thermal diffusivity 
2 
 
which  is  about  10-100  times  higher  than  that  of  steels.  In  other  words,  the  greater 
dissipation of heat through copper work-piece requires higher heat input for welding in 
comparison with other materials, resulting in quite low welding speeds. During arc welding 
of copper and copper alloys, oxygen segregates on grain boundaries of metal. This can lead 
to embrittlement of the weld joint. Precipitation hardenable copper alloys may lose their 
alloying  elements  (Zn)  through  oxidation  during  fusion  welding,  compromising  their 
strength. Copper welds frequently suffer from lack of fusion because of the high thermal 
conductivity of copper as it reduces the concentration of heat needed to melt a critical mass 
of metal and ensures complete filling of the weld cavity. Preliminary studies on the FSW for 
copper to copper [14-16] and brass [17-20] have also been reported earlier. 
In view of huge commercial importance of copper alloys and required for joining in 
fabrication of engineering components, this work was an attempt to study the corrosion 
resistance of friction stir welded copper-copper and brass-brass plates. The microstructure 
of the weld joints were observed before and after corrosion using optical microscope and 
mechanical  properties  such  as  hardness  were  determined. This  work  would  help  in 
understanding structure property relationship to construct and fabricate new components. 
Experimental Procedure 
Copper and Brass alloy plates (length√óbreadth√óthickness=60√ó40√ó6mm) were used in 
this present work. The chemical compositions of parent species were obtained from energy 
dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  attached  to  FESEM  (EDX  INCA,  OXFORD  Instruments.)  and 
measurements are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. The joints were fabricated by friction 
stir welding machine Biss-ITS. The tool bit used in this experiment made up of hot die 
steel- H13, designed as shown in figure 1 and has the hardness of 35.5 HRC. The welding 
parameters used are shown  in  Table  3.  Microstructure  evaluation  is  carried  out  using 
Optical microscope  (Leica  Microsystems  DMI5000M)  and  the  images  were  taken  in  the 
magnification range of 20X-50X. For corrosion study potentiodynamic polarization test was 
conducted  as  per  the  standard  ASTM  G  59-97 using  potentiostat  (IEC  61326, IVIUM 
technologies,  Netherland) on  friction  stir  welded  copper-copper and  brass-brass weld 
joints.  The  two  welded plates (Copper-Copper  &  Brass-Brass)  interface  junction  was 
compared with the parent metal. In this study a corrosive environment 0.2N HCl was used. 
Along with this, detailed corrosion study was carried out by immersion method (in 0.2N 
HCl) as well as salt spray (in 5% NaCl) methods. The parent and welded plates were polished 
by different grades of emery sheets to remove impurities present on the surface. The plates 
after corrosion were used as such to study the microstructure which is then compared with 
parent and welded plates respectively.

Corrosion study 
Potentiodynamic polarization curves (PR)  
A typical three-electrode electrochemical corrosion cell was used in all the experiments. 
A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as reference. All measured potentials were 
referred to this electrode. A platinum foil was used as the counter electrode. Then four 
plates parent copper, parent brass,  Friction  stir  welded  copper-copper  and  friction stir 
welded brass-brass plates were used as working electrodes. All experiments were carried 
out using ordinario without supporting neither electrolyte nor deareation. A potentiostat, 
controlled by a personal computer, equipped with a GPIB card and the commercial software 
was employed to obtain the potentiodynamic polarization curves. Before each experiment, 
the open circuit potential (OCP) was recorded for at least 30 min. Polarization curves was 
obtained  potentiodinamically;  the  linear  potential  sweep  was  performed  at a ¬±248 mV 
potential window around the measured OCP, from the cathodic to the anodic side, at scan 
rates of 0.1 and 1 mV s-1.

Salt Spray method (SS) 
Salt spray testing was conducted in accordance with ASTM B117 at Assured Testing 
Services, Ridgway, PA. This practice provides a controlled corrosive environment that has 
been utilized to produce relative corrosion resistance information for specimens of metals 
exposed in a test chamber. Prediction of performance in natural environments has seldom 
been correlated with salt spray results when used as stand-alone data. The apparatus for 
salt spray (fog) exposure consists of a fog chamber, a salt solution reservoir, a supply of 
suitably conditioned compressed air, one or more atomizing nozzles, specimen supports, 
provision for heating the chamber, and necessary means of control. Drops of the solution 
that accumulate on the ceiling or cover of the chamber shall not be permitted to fall on the 
specimens  being  exposed.  Drops  of  solution  that  fall  from  the  specimens  shall  not  be 
returned to the solution reservoir for re-spraying. All the four specimens were tested per 
material/process condition.  
 
Immersion method (IM) 
Polished specimens were initially weighed in an electronic balance. Weighed plates are 
immersed in 100 mL of the acid (0.2 N HCl). After 72 hrs, they were taken out and then 
washed thoroughly with tap water, rinsed with distilled water, dried, stored in desiccators 
and reweighed. From the change in weight of specimens the corrosion rate was calculated 
using the following relationship,

Results and Discussion 
Corrosion study analysis of Brass Plates 
Potentiodynamic polarization method 
Polarization resistance measurements are an accurate and rapid way to measure the 
general corrosion rate. Electrochemical polarization test methods are extremely pertinent 
5 
 

for understanding and evaluating the corrosion resistance of materials and the effect of 
changes in the corrosive environment. They can establish criteria for anodic or cathodic 
protection and susceptibility to several forms of corrosion. 
Figure 2 shows  the  potentiodynamic  polarization  curves  of  brass and  friction  stir 
welded  brass-brass in 0.2N HCl. Kabasakaloglu  et  al.  [21] have  concluded  that  the 
corrosion  process  of  brass  in  HCl  media  starts  at √¨1.0  V vs  SCE,  with  the  subsequent 
formation of ZnO/Zn(OH)2 and zinc ions. According to the authors, dissolution of copper is 
prevented up to the CuCl formation potential. Peaks observed at very negative potentials, 
i.e., around √¨1.3 V, have been attributed to the formation of ZnO/Zn(OH)2. However, this 
peak at very negative potentials has not been much studied yet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Morales et al. [22, 23], among others, have demonstrated that the dissolution of zinc 
takes place with anodic polarization even in the passive region. Actually, they showed that 
the  passive  layer  formed  on  Cu¬≤Zn  alloys  in  chloride-buffered  media  consists  of  a  film 
whose composition is ZnO.xH2O + Cu2O + CuO/Cu(OH)2 + CuCl [24-26]. During the anodic 
polarization, the dissolution of the passive film occurs above a certain potential, known as 
the breakdown potential, Eb, which shifts negatively as the chloride concentration increases. 
The authors have also concluded that brass is less resistant to corrosion than copper. The

breakdown of the passivity has been attributed to the formation of soluble species, i.e., 
chloro- and/or oxycomplexes.

In the present paper, a comparative study is performed on the voltammetric behavior of 
brass and friction stir welded brass-brass specimens. Polarization resistance can be related 
to the rate of general corrosion for metals at or near their corrosion potential, Ecorr. The 
figure 2 clarifies typical Tafel behavior that is greatly differing from that obtained for brass. 
This is because, for the active zinc metal in acid solutions, when dissolved in presence of 
oxygen, both hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions will be possible. However, 
in view of the fact that, the saturated solubility of oxygen in pure water at 25¬∞C is only 
about  10-3 mol  dm-3 [27]  and  decreases  slightly  with  increasing  the concentration  of 
dissolved salts. In addition, the concentration of H3O+ LQ M≈ÉLG VROXPLRQV MP S+ ¬ß 0 LV OLJO 
and  since  this  ion  has  a  high  rate  of  diffusion,  consequently,  the  contribution  of  the 
hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathodic process will overcome the oxygen reduction 
reaction. Therefore, the corrosion of zinc in acid solution proceeds via two partial reactions 
[28-29]. The partial cathodic reaction involves evolution of hydrogen gas.

The results of the polarization curve are shown in Table 4 in presence of 0.2N HCl at 
room temperature. It is observed that the parent brass metal shows high corrosion rate of 
0.2549 mm per year while friction stir welded brass imparts 0.1049 mm per year and it has 
better corrosion resistance. It is also to be noted that the corrosion current is also higher 
for  the  parent  metal  compared  to  the  welded  junction.  This  result  indicate  that in the 
friction stir welded brass sample, the weld joint act as a cathode and give better resistance 
to corrosion when compared to parent brass plates.

Corrosion study analysis of Copper Plates 
Figure 3 shows the potentiodynamic polarization curves of copper in 0.2N HCl. The 
electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization parameters, i.e. corrosion potential (Ecorr) and 
the  corrosion  current  density  (icorr),  obtained  from  the intersection  of  the  anodic  and 
cathodic Tafel lines with the corresponding corrosion potential are given in Table 7. It has 
been shown that in the Tafel extrapolation method, use of both the anodic and cathodic 
Tafel  regions  is  undoubtedly  preferred  over  the  use  of  only  one  Tafel  region [30].  The 
corrosion  rate  can  also  be  determined  by  Tafel  extrapolation  of  either  the  cathodic  or 
anodic polarization curve alone. If only one polarization curve alone is used, it is generally 
the cathodic curve which usually produces a longer and better defined Tafel region. Anodic 
8 
 

polarization  may  sometimes  produce  concentration  effects,  due  to  passivation  and 
dissolution, as well as roughening of the surface which can lead to deviations from Tafel 
behavior. 
The cathodic parts of the polarization curves show limiting current corresponds to the 
oxygen  reduction  reaction.  This  indicates  that  the  cathodic  process  is  controlled  by 
diffusion of oxygen gas from the bulk solution to the metal surface. This behavior is well 
known since copper can hardly be corroded in the deoxygenated dilute hydrochloric acid 
[31],  as  copper  cannot  displace  hydrogen  from  acid  solutions  according  to  theories  of 
chemical  thermodynamics.  However,  in  aerated  hydrochloric  acid,  dissolved  oxygen  is 
reduced on copper surface and this will enable some corrosion to take place [32]. Cathodic 
reduction  of  oxygen  can  be  expressed  either  by  two  consecutive  2e- steps  involving  a 
reduction to hydrogen peroxide first followed by a further reduction to water or by a direct 
4e- transfer step as shown by below equation.

The results of the polarization curve are shown in Table 7 in presence of 0.2N HCl at

it has better corrosion resistance. It is also to be noted that the corrosion current is also 
higher for the parent metal compared to the welded junction. This result indicate that in the 
friction  stir  welded  copper  sample,  the  weld  joint  act  as  a  cathode  and  give  better 
resistance to corrosion when compared to parent copper plate.

 Microstructure Analysis 
 
The microstructural characterizations of the 950 rpm FSW conditions of both brass-
brass and copper-copper plates were presented in Figure 4 (c) & Figure 5 (c) respectively. 
One can clearly observe joint has no defects or any other imperfections (lack of penetration, 
porosity etc..). 
Comparison of Figure 4 (a) & 4 (c) (brass before FSW & after FSW) and Figure 5 (a) & 5 
(c) (Copper before FSW & after FSW) clearly indicates the sample after FSW shows uniform 
grain size distribution. 
After the corrosion studies were conducted for brass plates, Figure 4 (b) (parent brass 
after corrosion) shows high dominating pits indicating high corrosion damage where as FSW 
brass-brass  sample (Figure  4  (d)) shows  comparatively  very  less  number  of  pits  after 
corrosion indicating a low corrosion rate. 
Copper plates on  observed  after  the  corrosion  studies shows, Figure 5 (b) (parent 
copper after corrosion) shows large number of pits indicating high corrosion damage where 
as FSW copper-copper sample (Figure 5 (d)) shows comparatively very less number of pits 
after corrosion indicating a low corrosion rate.

Hardness 
Vickers Hardness values of parent and welded plates were shown in table 10 and it is 
observed hardness increased in welded plates as compared with parent plates. The reason 
may  be  attributed  as  large  deformation  twins  and  slightly  elongated  grain  structures  in 
parent plates. However, the elongated grain structure disappeared near the weld zone. The 
grain size was slightly increased by the annealing effect of welding heat. The exact central 
region  of  weld  zone  would  have  very  fine  and  equiaxied  grain  structure  due  to  the 
recrystallization  caused  by  simultaneously  received  the  plastic  shear  deformation  and 
frictional heat.

Conclusion 
The brass-brass and copper-copper plates were successfully welded using friction stir 
welding without failures or imperfections in the joints. On comparison with parent plates 
the Vickers hardness values showed an increment. Corrosion studies shows that the FSW 
plates are less prone to corrosion than parent plates. Moreover it is also observed from 
corrosion  studies  that  the  brass plates are  more  corroded  when  compared  with  copper 
plates and the reason for this can be attributed as dealloying in brass.
