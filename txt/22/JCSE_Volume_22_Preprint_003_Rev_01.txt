Abstract 
The  comparison  study  of  corrosive  properties  of  polyester  and  epoxy  reinforced  silane 
treated  glass  fibre  in  primer  coatings  application  was  successfully  done. The  study  was 
carried  out  by  varying  the  glass  fibre  loadings  from  0-40%  to  establish the  optimum 
corrosive  behaviour  of  the  coatings. The  corrosive  properties  was  characterized  using 
autolab potentiostat and immersion testing using 3.5% NaCl for 9 days. The result showed 
that the optimum corrosion rate of both coatings were found at 10% and 20% of glass fibre 
loadings  for  polyester  and  epoxy  coatings  respectively. Whilst,  the  corrosion  rate  of 
polyester  coating as  compared  to epoxy  coatings  which  is  0.77735  mmpy and 10.673 
mmpy for  epoxy  coatings. This  is  due  to  the  properties  of  polyester  that  is  highest  in 
adhesion towards the substrate and it is also due to the good interaction of GF with the 
resin has been achieved via silane coupling agent and dispersed well in order to protect the 
pores from opening and allowing the ions to enter the subtrates. For immersion testing, the 
results followed the same trend as the corrosion rate measurement test for both of the 
resins.

Introduction 
Generally, coating is a covering technique that is applied to the surface of the substrate. It 
offers many advantages like adhesion, corrosion resistance, or wear resistance. Protective 
coatings enhance and increase life of coated systems. It also can be used as foundation and 
act as primer for paint system. The primer coatings are crucial to ensure good adhesion of 
paint, improve durability and give protection to the substrate [1] Primer is a paint product 
that  allows  finishing  paint  to  adhere much  better  than  if  it  was  used  alone.  It  is  also 
designed to form a binding layer that is better prepared to receive the paint. Priming layer 
should contain corrosion inhibitors such as epoxy or polyester that can protect underlying 
surface by protective actions to create a better protective coating. [2] 
Epoxy resins which are any class of resins derived by polymerization from epoxides that 
polymerizes  when  mixed  with  catalyzing  agent  or  hardener.  Epoxy  is  usually  used  in 
adhesives,  coatings,  electrical  insulation,  solder  mix  and  castings.  Epoxy  coatings  can 
provide high bonding strength and high chemical resistance to substrates. Epoxy has much 
better  physical  and  adhesion  properties.  Hence,  the  epoxy  resin  is  used  in  various 
industries including the aerospace, automotive, platform oil and gas and marine industries 
[3] 
Polyester (PE) is a class of polymers that include the functional group of ester in their main 
chain. PE resins commonly  used  as  a  primer,  undercoat  and  clear  coat  for  coating. 
Polyesters resins have an excellent adhesion and high strength. Besides that, due to its high 
in gloss, hardness and impact resistance, as well as have fast cure characteristic, make it 
widely used in coatings. PE resins have a very low cost, easy to process, excellent wetting 
properties  with  reinforcement,  offer  a  good  balance  of  properties  and  available  in  wide 
variety of grades [4-5] 
 However,  both  polyester  and  epoxy  resin  have disadvantages  in  coatings  process. The 
polyester is easily to be attacked by acids and bases that reduce the corrosive properties [6] 
Polyesters resins also have low thermal resistance, poor solvent resistance, and need to be 
dried in dehumidifier to prevent hydrolytic degradation. The disadvantage of pure epoxy

resins is their low fracture toughness. So, the epoxy and polyester needs to be reinforced 
with the glass fiber for the protective corrosion application in oil and gas platform [7] 
 
 Glass  fiber  (GF)  is  a  material  consisting  of  various  extremely  fine  fibers  of  glass.  The 
advantages of GF are high temperature resistance, non flammable, corrosion-resistance, 
heat-insulation  and  high  tensile  strength.  GF  has  comparable  mechanical  properties  to 
other fibers such as polymers and carbon fiber. It is also a strong, lightweight material and 
is used for many products. GF is used for the building of boats and sports car bodies and 
use  has  broadened  to  the  automotive  and  sport  equipment  sectors [8] However, 
compatibility of GF with polymeric matrix is very poor due to different polarity between PE 
and ER with GF that contain many (OH) which is polar [9-10]. Hence, silane coupling agent 
is incorporated with the coatings to improve its compatibility. 
 
Silane coupling agent is useful to improve the compatibility between the matrix and the 
fiber thus improving the mechanical properties of the biocomposite [11]. Besides that, 
silane coupling agent can increased the tensile strength and adhesion between matrix-
fiber. Jia and Ling [12] found that Al2O3 particles that being treated with silane coupling 
agent makes the Al2O3 particles better distributed and have better bonding with the PA1010 
matrix in Al2O3/PA1010 composite. In this research, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APE) 
is used as coupling agent because it can react with the hydroxyl group of GF. 
Chemicals and equipments 
The chemicals used in this research were purchased from Fluka and used without further 
purification.  The  chemicals  used  were  ethanol,  silane  coupling  agent  (3-aminopropyl 
triethoxysilane)  ,  sodium  chloride  (NaCl),  DER  354  epoxy  resin,  curing  agent  for  epoxy 
(amine), polyester resin (SYNOLAC 9605S65 MY), curing agent for polyester which is methyl 
ethyl  ketone  peroxide  (MEKP),     ˤ     
sulphate. The equipments that used in this research were carbon steel plate (15 cm × 10 
cm  ×  0.2  cm),  hand  brushes,  high  speed  stirrer,  Impedance  Analyzer  which  model  is 
Autolab PGSTAT240, siever-325 mesh model and Nichiban tape.

Methodology 
Pre-coating of carbon steel plate  
Each of the carbon steel plate(15 cm × 10 cm × 0.2 cm) surfaces was degreased by using 
sand papers and washed with acetone followed by distilled water. Then, allowed them to 
dry at room temperature.  
Preparation of ER-GF and PE-GF mixture  
The  40  g  of  GF  were immersed in 5%  wt  of  3-aminopropyl  triethoxysilane  and  ethanol 
solution for 24 h. Then, the mixture were filtered and dried at 80oC in an oven for 6 h. The 
treated  GF  modified  with  5%  of  3-aminopropyl  triethoxysilane  were  grounded  using  a 
mortar  and  sieved  using  325     ˤ       
sulphate  were  added  into  distilled  water  and  stirred  roughly.  The  treated  GF  and  the 
mixture of zinc powder and zinc sulphate were added into epoxy and polyester resin and 
dispersed at high speed (1500 r/min) using high speed stirrer until the uniform dispersion 
obtained.  
Preparation of wet paint to coat the steel plate  
25 ml of the prepared coatings was applied to the surface of carbon steel plates by using 
hand brush to coat them for 3 layers. Lastly, the paint on the steel was left to cure for 7 
days  at  room  temperature.  Then,  the  testing  and  characterization  of  the coatings  were 
carried out. 
Corrosive properties testing 
Autolab PGSTAT204 (potentiostat/galvanostat)  
The coated steel plate was immersed into the 3.5% NaCl solution that placed in the beaker 
together  with  platinum  foil  and  a  saturated  calomel  electrode  which  act  as  counter 
electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The coated steel plate acted as a working 
electrode. Then, the results obtained were analysed. The polarization analysis conducted at 
the  open  circuit  potential,  using  an  Autolab  PGSTAT204  potentiostat/galvanostat.  The 
current range was performing around 1mA.

Immersion test  
All the carbon steel plate was scratched as "X" scratch presenting to the substrates on the 
covering surface of the plate. Then, the coated carbon steel was immersed in sea water and 
salt solution (3.5% of NaCl) for 9 days at room temperature. The coated carbon steel was 
observed  within  3  days  of  the  time  intervals  and  the  visual  observation  were  recorded 
precisely by a camera. 
Results and discussion 
Fourier Transformer-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis  
FTIR analysis was done in this research to determine the functional group exists as the 
glass fibers were treated with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane that acts as coupling agent. 
The purpose of this analysis is also to determine the cross linking between the glass fibers 
and the coupling agent.  
Figure  1  shows  the  peak  at  1221.12cm-1 corresponding  to  silanol  group  from  silane 
coupling agent confirmed the modification process has been successfully done. The FTIR 
spectra  show  that  the  peak  of  hydroxyl  group  of  GF  at 947.69cm-1 was  decreased  and 
shifted  by  applying  the 3-aminopropyl  triethoxysilane treatment.  This  is  due  to  the 
interaction between polar group of coupling agent and the hydroxyl group of GF. Whist the 
peak at 1711.16 cm-1 corresponding to C=O functional groups [7] According to Chun & 
Taylor [13], silanization involves the hydrolysis of silane in order to produce silanol then 
condensation between silanols and covalent bond formation which form between siloxane 
and GF.

The carbon steel plate was immersed into 3.5% NaCl solution at normal room temperature. 
The reference electrode that used in this study is the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), 
which consists of mercury covered with a paste of mercurous chloride and mercury in a 
chloride solution. It will gives a stable and reproducible potential in the solution. The Ecorr, 
Icorr,  corrosion rate  and polarization resistance  were  determined  from  the  Tafel  plot of 
epoxy coating that resulted from the potentiostat/galvanostat [14] The results for the five 
coatings  can  be  obtained  from  the  Tafel  plot  that  provides  a  quick  estimation  of  the 
corrosion rate and polarization resistance, Rp. The corrosion rate is calculated from the 
estimated corrosion current, Icorr that can be obtained from the intercept of the two linear 
segment of the Tafel plot.

Tafel polarization measurements showed that the higher the loadings of GF from 10-20%, 
the  lowest  the  corrosion  rate  for  PE-GF  coatings  and  ER-GF  coatings. The  utilization of 
glass fiber in the coatings makes the corrosion protection increased and the steel plate last 
longer. The high values of potential of corrosion towards negative path indicates that high 
susceptibility of steel to corrosion as the corrosion process was related to the diffusion of 
water, ions and oxygen from the environment or from the polymer matrix itself [15] It was 
clear from these results that lowest loading of glass fiber (10-20%) was the best corrosion 
resistant  than  others.  The  higher  the  corrosion  potential  will  shifted  the  graph  towards 
positive  directions,  and  the  lower  corrosion  current  will  make  the  corrosion  rate  to  be 
increased as well as polarization resistance. The pore or coating resistance relates to the 
diffusion  of  electrolyte  through  the  organic  coating  via  the  pore,  which  can  affect  the 
barrier properties of the coating while the polarization resistance is the ionic resistance of 
the  coating  which  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  area  of  surface  defects  (pores).  The 
polarization resistance role is to defend the coatings from the diffusion of ions into the 
substrate plate.  
 
Table 1 shows the optimum formulation of ER-GF coatings for the corrosion rate at 20% of 
glass fibers which give the lowest corrosion rate at 10.673 milimeter per year (mmpy). This 
is due to the utilization of GF make steel plate do not corrode and last longer. It shows that 
at 20% loading of glass fibers, the coating exhibits better barrier property among the other 
four coatings. ER-ˑ
which indicates  that  the  higher  the  value of  Rp,  the  higher  the resistance  of  the  epoxy 
coating towards the corrosion [16] For PE-GF coatings, the optimum formulation was PE-GF 
10% as the corrosion rate was the lowest which was 0.77735 mmpy. The utilization of 10% 
glass  fiber  corrosion  protection  is  increased  and  make  the  steel  plate  last  longer.  
According to Ramesh. D., & Vasudevan. T., [15] as compound of the treated glass fiber 
which  has  loadings  of  10%  gives  the  optimum  results  due  to  the  particles  with  lower 
loadings  of  the  pigments  completely  surrounded  by  the  binder  and  protected  from  the 
diffusion of electrolytes as the pores or voids were closely packed. At 10% of GF loadings 
also  gives  the  highest  Rp  value  at  ˑwhich  is  higher  the  resistance  towards 
electrolyte.

Then, the other formulations in ER-GF coatings which have the loadings of GF at  10%, 30%  
and  40% gives the  corrosion  rates  at  16.487  mmpy, 24.166  mmpy and  64.487  mmpy, 
respectively.  Whilst, PE-GF coatings, the other formulations at 20%, 30%, and 40% of GF 
loadings give the highest corrosion rate at  5.711mmpy, 9.399 mmpy, and 10.991 mmpy, 
respectively.It is believed, the higher the content of the glass fibers on the coating, the 
resins cannot  block  the  pores  on  the  coating.  So,  the  electrolyte  solution  gradually 
permeated into the coating that gives the higher corrosion rate. The corrosion activity will 
happen faster on the substrate if the corrosion rate is higher. This is in line with the finding 
from Yue et al., [14] With the presence of treated glass fiber in the coating formulations will 
improved the corrosion rate as well as protected the steel of plates by performed a good 
interaction  with  the  resin.  The  good  interaction  of  glass  fiber  with  the  resin  has  been 
achieved via silane coupling agent and dispersed well in order to protect the pores from 
opening and allowing the ions to enter the subtrates and hence corroded the surface of 
coatings. However, the increment in the value of glass fiber loadings also increased the 
micro-defects in polymer coating which will lead to the weak coating barrier property. 
 
The control sample has the highest corrosion rate due to the penetration of ions into the 
substrate as the substrates was not covered with the glass fiber that have higher corrosion 
resistance. The  different  barrier  properties  of  coatings are  due to  the  contents  of  glass 
fibers. When the solution diffuses into the coating, the glass fibers can avoid the water from 
permeating and extend the water diffusion path. Water can pass through coating of control 
sample and reach the substrate surface easily because coating has none pigment. So, the 
corrosion rates increase compared to the other coatings [7] 
 
Immersion test  
 
The results of immersion testing in seawater and salt solution follows the same trend with 
tafel polarization measurements which is the higher the loadings of GF from 10-20%, the 
lowest  the  corrosion occur  on  steel  plate for  PE-GF  coatings  and  ER-GF  coatings. The 
utilization of glass fiber in the coatings makes the corrosion protection increased and the 
steel plate last longer.

The optimum result that give the good barrier property was at 20% volume fraction of glass 
fibers on epoxy coating. It gives no contact between metal substrate and electrolyte as they 
cannot pass through the coating surfaces. It also shows the optimum result for corrosion as 
it  only  shows  small  flacking  without  the         
immersion. The highest corrosive resistance of coating for PE-GF coatings was at 10% of GF 
loadings as the plate was not corroded at all as well as the blistering and flaking was not 
occurred.  This  is  due  to  the glass  fiber  content  that  is  suitable  enough  to  inhibit  the 
corrosion to occur. The content of glass fiber in the coating gives no contact between the 
electrolyte and metal substrate and the coating exhibits better barrier property than other 
formulations of coatings [7] 
 
For the control sample in the epoxy coatings, 
because at 0% glass fiber, epoxy resin alone and does not have the inhibition properties to 
combat corrosion on the carbon steel plate. ER have poor resistance towards electrolyte, so 
coating resistance is low and corrosion occurred. As for 10% of glass fibers loadings, the 
epoxy coating shows that the coating started to peel off after 9 days of immersion showing 
improved  corrosion  properties  as  compared  to  control  sample.  A  little  bit  flacking  and 
 
 
The control sample for PE-GF coatings displays the most corroded steel plate followed by 
others formulation. According to Golgoon. A. et al., [17] the corrosion occurred in control 
sample because polyester have poor resistance to electrolyte and thus make the coating 
resistance  reduced  and  corrosion  occurred.  For  PE-GF  at  20-40%  of  GF  loadings,  the 
corrosion occurs as the content of glass fiber was too high which do not able to protect the 
coating  as  the  more  micro-defects  occurred  as  stated  in  the  research studied  by 
Yongsheng, H. et al., [7]  
 
The immersion test results by using 3.5% of NaCl solution as a medium solution shows the 
higher rate of corrosion when compared to the immersion in seawater as the salt solution 
was more aggressive towards carbon steel plate than sea water [18]. For this testing, the 
trends were similar as the sea water immersion testing whereas the best formulation for

epoxy coating in NaCl solution is at 20% of glass fibers loading is suitable enough to inhibit 
corrosion propertie
The different contents of the glass fibers in five coatings give different barrier properties of 
these coatings [8] The best corrosive resistance properties of coating in PE-GF was at 10% 
GF  loadings,  while  the  most  corroded  properties  was  obtained  for  other  formulations. 
According to Yongsheng, H. et al., [7] in his research, glass fiber functions to inhibit the 
corrosive  medium  to  pass  through  the  coating.  It  means  that  the  contact  between 
electrolyte and metal substrate was not occurred which resulting in no corrosion occurred. 
The loading of glass fiber in formulation 2 (PE-GF 10%) is the optimum as no micro-defects 
appeared on the coatings surface.   
 
The coatings for control sample in ER-GF coatings and PE-GF coatings  were most corroded 
after 9 days of immersion. The control sample have no glass fiber added to the coating 
indicates that the water can pass through the coating and reach the surface of the carbon 
steel plate easily. It is apparent that the glass fiber can prevent the water from permeating 
into the substrate. As for other formulations, a 
is  due  to  too  high  content  of  glass  fibers added  into  epoxy  coating  which increase  the 
micro-defects that will result to the weak coating barrier property of the coating [7]

Conclusion 
Corrosive properties of polyester and epoxy reinforced silane treated glass fibre in primer 
coatings application were studied. FTIR spectrums showed that the silane coupling agent 
grafted onto the glass fiber. The alkyl group of the coupling agent has compatibility with 
the  resin  and  so  the  glass  fiber  can  combine  with  epoxy  and  polyester  resin  tightly 
processed by silane coupling agent. The results confirmed the modification of glass fiber 
with  3-aminopropyl  triethoxysilane  has  been  successfully  done. The corrosion  rate  for 
epoxy coatings tested by using galvanostat shows that the optimum formulation is at 20% 
of GF loadings as the corrosion rate was 10.673 mmpy while for polyester coatings, the 
optimum result was at 10% of GF loadings with 0.77735 mmpy. Here it can be conclude 
that polyester is better than epoxy due to the lowest corrosion rate. This is due to the

properties of polyester that is highest in adhesion towards the substrate and it is also due 
to the good interaction of GF with the resin has been achieved via silane coupling agent and 
dispersed well in order to protect the pores from opening and allowing the ions to enter the 
subtrates. For immersion testing, the results followed the same trend as the corrosion rate 
measurement test for both of the resins. However, the higher loadings of GF lead to the 
corrosion of the coatings of epoxy and polyester. When the loadings were increased, the 
protection ability  of  the  coatings  is  reduced  as  more  of  micro-defects  occurred  in  the 
coating system and would affect the corrosive properties.
