<p>The use of Zinc
Ethyl Silicate shop primers and their desired properties have been explained.
Three primers with zinc contents of 46% by weight, 36% by weight and 18% by
weight have been studied. A comparison of change of potential with time when
immersed in 3.5%w/w sodium chloride solution has found the curves show similar characteristics
to literature work but in a shorter time period. Immersion in artificial
Manchester rainwater (AMR) has shown the potential initially moves toward that
of steel before stabilising when pH approaches neutrality and the solution
becomes less aggressive. The behaviour of the three coatings is much closer
with immersion in AMR but only the 18% coating has shown any visible sign of
steel corrosion and that is in 3.5%w/w sodium chloride solution. SEM images
show the size, distribution, connectivity and clustering of zinc within the
coatings. This allows for evidence of the protective action to be studied
later.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>A variety of reasons
exist to ensure the success of anti-corrosive coatings within the ship building
industry. To commercial producers and users these range from economic and image
issues to the importance of safety. A comprehensive understanding of the
processes involved in the protective properties of these coatings is necessary.
This study is particularly concerned with the first available opportunity to
protect the steel, as the earlier protection can be applied the better the it
becomes in the later stages [1]. The initial coating applied to the steel is
known as the �shop primer� which utilises low levels of zinc metal giving
�weldability� to the primer.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Modern ships are
built using �blocks� and these blocks are formed from steel that has been
primed (Figure 1). The primer protects the steel while it is stored in the
marine atmosphere where the majority of shipyards are located. The primer also
forms part of the completed coating system. On delivery the steel plate that
forms the blocks can be covered in millscale. This is undesirable due to the
rapid way millscale delaminates when exposed to heat and thus removing any
paint applied over it. The millscale is removed by abrasive blasting which
gives the steel a blast profile of ~70mm [2]. This freshly cleaned surface wishes
to oxidise therefore the blasting and primer application are carried out on an
automated continuous line [3]. The primer should be compatible with cutting,
bending and welding providing corrosion protection by a thin coating. The
coatings should provide short term corrosion protection from the atmosphere in
marine environments.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Early shop
primers were poly vinyl butytral (PVB) types and iron oxide pigmented epoxy
paints. The shop primers used today are zinc silicate coatings with successive
generations having reduced zinc content. It is this content compared to the
level of success of corrosion protection stipulated by Evans &amp; Mayne [3,4]
that is not fully understood and the purpose of this study is to examine this
adventitious performance.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>Three experimental coatings provided by <i>International Coatings Ltd </i>have been
used in this study. The coatings are based on commercially available products
that provide corrosion protection when used. The coatings are of the two-pack
type. The coatings were prepared using the manufacturers mix ratios and applied
to Q-panels (151mm � 101mm � 1.5mm) using a draw bar method. Table 1
identifies the coatings under test and their properties.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>The coatings
become touch dry within 5-10 minutes and were allowed to cure in an atmosphere
of 20-25�C, 75-85%RH for 10 days. Assessment of cure was
carried out using a solvent resistance test. The pass mark was no loss of film
thickness.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>Contacts were
attached to the panels, which were then edged and backed with beeswax:
colophony resin mixture (4:1). The panels were then immersed continuously in
3.5% weight/weight sodium chloride solution and artificial Manchester rainwater
solution [5]. Potential versus time was measured using a saturated calomel
electrode. SEM was carried out using an AMRAY 1810 operating at �20KeV in
secondary electron and backscatter electron detection. </p>

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>In order to build
up an understanding of this type of coating it was decided to monitor potential
with respect to time by immersion in 3.5%w/w sodium chloride solution. This
solution was chosen to allow comparison with work reported in the literature.
It was also decided to monitor the potential at open circuit rather than
imposing a current because of the low levels of zinc would have a shorter
protection time [6].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>The electrolyte
solution is particularly aggressive with regard to low-level zinc silicate shop
primers that were not designed for immersion in such solutions. Artificial
Manchester Rainwater (AMR) was selected to evaluate performance in acidic
conditions. Again, the coatings were not designed for immersion in such
solutions but nevertheless results will be useful in understanding coating
performance. The use of AMR fits in with a program of work that is explained
later in this paper.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>Table 2 shows the
time taken in hours for the system potential to reach the protection potential
of steel at �780mV/SCE [7]. It would be expected that increasing zinc content
would have increasing protection time.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>As previously
observed in the literature [8], the potential vs time curve exhibits an initial
drop in potential before a steady rise and levelling towards the potential of
steel (Figure 2).� The extent of the
initial part of the curve indicates the extent of the cathodic protection.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>Initially the
curve shows an activation of the zinc while the potential moves to that of zinc
plate. This is followed by a stabilisation period as corrosion products begin
to form.� As the galvanic activity slows
the potential begins to move towards that of steel [8-14].� It should be said that this model concerns
zinc rich coatings but these zinc silicate shop primers have similar curves in
a shorter time scale. Table 3 shows a selection of coating systems and the time
to reach the protection potential of steel.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>The behaviour of
the coating system in AMR is what would be expected. The potential vs time
curve shows that the trend of higher zinc content giving extended lifetime is
observed (Figure 3). The corrosion rate is accelerated at the extremes of pH
[15]. The zinc corrosion reaction takes part in a neutralisation of the pH
which moves from pH 4.5 to pH 6.5 within 24 to 30 hours. The potential vs time
curves appear to stabilise following a sharp movement to more noble values.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>Visual
observations of the coated panels under immersion in both electrolytes show
that at the reading taken at 1200 hours ZS18, ZS36 &amp; ZS46 had sites of iron
rust. ZS18 began to exhibit iron rust at 650 hours while ZS36 showed sites at
700 hours (Figure 4). ZS63 coated panels have a �patchy� appearance where the
colour is a slightly different tone in places compared to pre-exposure at 1200
hours.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p>SEM observations
and analysis of the unexposed coatings indicate the arrangement of the zinc
particles and the situations of sites and types of corrosion. Arrangements
within the coatings would show pathways for both electronic and ionic
conduction. Ionic conduction pathways would take the form of cracks, binder and
voids. Electronic conduction pathways would take the form of particle to
particle to steel connectivity as illustrated by Morcillo [21].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p>Figures 5-8 show
zinc x-ray maps acquired using the SEM show the situations that the zinc finds
itself in over the four coatings. ZS63 (Figure 5) shows a relatively high
density of particles which coincides with zinc to zinc connectivity. This
higher density makes the gaps in the coating more apparent. The figure provides
a good example of the conduction pathways discussed above. It can be seen from
the ZS46 map (Figure 6) that the zinc is in clusters with an apparent
inter-cluster connectivity. The is also evidence of connectivity between the
clusters and the substrate. The connectivity is not as great as observed in
zinc rich coatings [21]. Figures 7 &amp; 8 show significantly less zinc and
connectivity for the ZS36 &amp; ZS18 coatings respectively than observed with
ZS63 &amp; ZS18.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p>Work carried out
by Morcillo [21] suggests that zinc in clusters which affords cathodic protection
will show localised attack whereas isolated zinc will be surrounded by a layer
of zinc corrosion product. These SEM images show that there is a certain degree
of zinc to zinc to steel contact that can give cathodic protection.� This can be partly observed with figures
9-11.� Figure 9 shows a SEM photograph
of a large particle in a ZS46 coating that has undergone localised attack.� The outer �ring� that can be observed contains
chlorine, as shown by elemental analysis. This is indicative of corrosion
product but is by no means an absolute method of determining the existence of
corrosion product. Visually, it is difficult other than in this case to
differentiate between silicate binder and corrosion product.� It can be said at this point further analysis
is needed to determine the exact nature of the �ring� though current work
indicates the possible existence of corrosion product.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(29)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 10 shows a
ZS36 coating that contains a number of voids along with a zinc particle in
contact with the substrate and exhibiting localised corrosion.� As yet it has not been possible to determine
whether any corrosion product is left in the voids.� This could be due to the type of exposure i.e. continuous
immersion where the corrosion product is dissolved into the electrolyte. The
coatings do have a number of voids present before exposure and observations
indicate an increase in number with exposure.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 11 shows
localised attack on a small particle in a ZS63 coating and again there is
evidence of the outer �ring� which also contains a level of chlorine indicating
corrosion product.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p>At this stage the
work appears to disagree with that of Morcillo [21] where corrosion product is
found around zinc particles that are or have been in contact with other
particles and the substrate along with localised corrosion on the zinc. This
could be explained by the fundamental differences in the coatings (zinc-rich
and low zinc); by the thickness of the dry film (50-60mm compared to 20mm); or by the protective mechanism of the
coating. �This piece of work forms part
of the evidence in investigating the last point.</p><img border="0" src="../paper24/figure%205.jpg" align="left" width="983" height="137"><br clear=all>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(36)</SCRIPT><p>The behaviour of
the coatings when immersed in 3.5%w/w sodium chloride solution has been shown
to be similar in character albeit in a smaller time frame to literature work.
Improvements in coating technology driven by the desire to increase ship
building time may have lead to current shop primers performing better when
welded and exposed than previous experience with low-level zinc coatings. It
must be remembered that these coatings were not designed for immersion in
aggressive solutions. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(37)</SCRIPT><p>The use of AMR
shows that corrosion occurs faster initially before stabilising. As the
electrolyte is not refreshed the pH increases to neutral values to create a
less aggressive environment. The range of exposures to be studied will in
future include cyclic immersion and prohesion/spray to simulate rain pooling
and rainfall. Alongside potential vs time, the barrier development with time,
SEM observations with time and zinc content with time will be studied.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(38)</SCRIPT><p>The SEM images have
shown the distribution, size, connectivity and clustering of zinc particles in
the coatings.� This establishes the type
and number of electronic and ionic conduction pathways in the coatings.
Localised corrosion of zinc particles has been observed which according to
Morcillo [21] indicates the mechanism of cathodic protection. If this is the
case then the extent of this protection in providing barrier properties is to
be investigated. </p>
