    <p>Two standard coatings containing inhibitive pigments were scribed and the

    degree of protection afforded was investigated when the specimens were

    immersed in 10% Harrison's solution. This was assessed both visually, using

    ferricyanide solution and electrochemically. The Electrochemical Noise

    Method was used to monitor corrosion and it was found that the higher the

    value of R<sub>n</sub> the greater the degree of protection afforded. The

    Scanning Reference Electrode Technique was also used on the same scribed

    coatings. These results which provided an indication of the amount of anodic

    activity along the scribe correlated well with the Electrochemical Noise

    results. The effect of a pre-soak in de-mineralised water was also

    investigated. It is suggested that the two methods when used together can

    provide the means by which paint manufacturers can quickly and easily assess

    the effectiveness of their systems in preventing corrosion at a break in the

    coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

    <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>At University College Northampton there has been a programme of work

    investigating electrochemical techniques to examine intact organic coatings

    on steel. Many researchers have tried to use the AC impedance method for

    this [1]. Some of the fairly recent papers using this method are summarised

    in a review by Murray [2]. Although this method is of undoubted use it

    produces a lot of information which is sometimes difficult to interpret and

    from an experimental disadvantage point of view, is electrically intrusive.

    In the search for a relatively simple technique to replace the successful DC

    resistance method (also electrically intrusive), the Electrochemical Noise

    Method (ENM) was selected. This has now been quite extensively investigated

    [3]. This followed on from previous work by Skerry [4,5] at

    Sherwin-Williams, Cleveland and by Bierwagen's group [6,7] at NDSU in Fargo,

    North Dakota. Recent work by two of the present authors has examined

    detached and waterborne coatings on steel and aluminium [3,8]. The study has

    now progressed to examine defects in coatings - deliberately created either

    using a scribe or by laser ablation. Some interesting electrical responses

    have been obtained and there is indirect evidence of processes occurring at

    the scribed area such as protective film formation. However what was

    lacking, particularly in the early stages of exposure, was direct evidence

    of microscopic and local electrochemical activity as a function of time.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>At Sheffield and elsewhere SRET (Scanning Reference Electrode Technique)

    has been used and modified to study a variety of corrosion processes [9-12].

    With the ability to give localised, quantitative information about anodic

    and cathodic processes it has proved a very useful tool. Particularly useful

    for coatings evaluation is the rotational configured SRET as application is

    easy and the problem of height variation is minimised. A project in early

    1998 looked at a Polyaniline coating on steel using SRET. As expected from

    previous work with intact coatings, the high resistance of the coating made

    it difficult to &quot;pick up&quot; anodic and cathodic areas, at least

    during the initial stages of exposure. However when used to examine

    deliberately created circular defects results proved quite promising.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>The general aim of the work described in this paper is to identify a fast

    laboratory test method to assess the effectiveness of inhibitive materials

    within a coating to protect the substrate at a break. Previous studies

    looking at point defects or scribes in coatings include work by De Wit using

    AC Impedance [13] and work by Mills using the DC resistance method [14]. A

    further objective of the work is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the

    coating behaviour where protection takes place. Defects are being

    investigated in several solvent-borne and water-borne primers on steel using

    the Electrochemical Noise Method. Reported here are results for two

    proprietary primers, an epoxy (CM) and an alkyd (RH). Red Lead in linseed

    oil has also been investigated along with a control (water-borne unpigmented

    epoxy). All apart from the control contain inhibitive pigments in the

    coatings. Defects were produced mainly by scribing.&nbsp; Resistance (R<sub>n</sub>)

    measurements were monitored as a function of time in either de-mineralised

    water or 10% Harrison's solution. It was found that none of the inhibitive

    coatings were successful in preventing corrosion upon immediate immersion in

    10% Harrison�s solution. So coatings were given a pre-soak by immersing

    for a time of 24 or 96 h in de-mineralised water. SRET has also been used to

    examine scribed (deliberately damaged) areas in the same solutions over a

    similar period of time. The expectation is that SRET would be able to

    provide useful information about the initial stages of passivity, or of

    substrate damage i.e. corrosion, at the (initially) bare metal area.</p>

    <h3><b>Experimental</b></h3>

    <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>The substrate used was steel Q panels or steel circular (22mm diameter)

    SRET specimens. The two solvent-borne primers CM (epoxy) and RH (alkyd) were

    expected to contain inhibitive pigments based on zinc phosphate and zinc

    tetroxy chromate respectively. The solvent for the amine portion in the

    unpigmented epoxy (IC 152) was water. This coating would not be expected to

    contain any components that would lead to effective inhibition at a scribe.

    The red lead was in linseed oil. It was used because it was expected to be

    effective. Coatings were applied by spreader bar to Q panels and by dipping

    for SRET specimens. Harrison�s solution (3.5% ammonium sulphate, 0.5% NaCl)

    was used unless indicated otherwise at 10% dilution for the tests reported

    here.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>Most of the Electrochemical Noise results for CM and RH coatings were

    obtained from the same samples used for SRET (i.e. cylinders). The beaker

    method was employed. This is shown in Figure 1. Fresh scribes were made

    either with or without re-coating before SRET measurements. Noise results

    from the red lead and IC 152 were obtained from Q panel samples using the

    bridge method [3]. Blanking was achieved using a 75 / 25 mix of beeswax and

    colophony resin. The scratch area was typically 0.02cm<sup>2 </sup>(10mm x

    0.2mm). The scribes were produced by a novel mechanical removal technique

    using a specially designed tool that removes the area of coating rather than

    displacing it by plastic/elastic deformation. The cutting edge of the blade

    resembles a small lathe (part-off tool) when viewed under magnification.

    This lifts the coating and shears the edges of the cut to give a square

    section scribe with an easily calculable area and leads to more reproducible

    results. Potassium ferricyanide indicator was used throughout this work to

    establish if corrosion was actually taking place at a particular point at a

    particular time. The indicator is very sensitive to Fe<sup>++</sup> ions, a

    blue colour can be detected even when only traces of iron ions are present.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>Electrochemical Noise was measured using a zero resistance ammeter and

    data logger with dedicated software supplied by ACM. Measurements are

    generally made every half-second for a period of 300 s. The current between

    the two working electrodes is monitored and at the same time the voltage of

    the pair is measured with respect to the reference electrode. From the

    standard deviations of the resultant 300 data points, the voltage noise and

    current noise are calculated. By dividing the former by the latter, the

    parameter Noise Resistance (R<sub>n</sub>) is derived. Further details can

    be found elsewhere [3,8].</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>SRET results were obtained by mapping over an area of 1cm by 1.5cm that

    included the scribe. The specimen was rotated at 100rpm and the measurements

    were taken over a period of up to about thirty hours. A diagram showing the

    experimental set-up is shown in Figure 2. Further details on the

    experimental set-up can be found [9,10].&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><b>Results and Discussion&nbsp;</b></h3>

    <h4>Electrochemical Noise</h4>

    <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>Although not given here intact coatings were also investigated which gave

    R<sub>n </sub>values that were considerably higher than the scribed sample

    results. Thus all values here are attributed to the scribe. Figure 3 shows

    the comparison between the clear epoxy and the CM coating after just 2 h in

    solution. It can be seen that the R<sub>n </sub>value of the CM coating is

    approximately an order of magnitude higher than the unpigmented epoxy.&nbsp;

    Reproducibility among the four different pairs was very good. Figure 4 shows

    the effect of time over a 24 h period for both CM and RH coatings in 10%

    Harrison�s solution. Initially the CM coating provided a level of

    inhibition (corresponding to an increase in the R<sub>n</sub> value).

    However within 24h both coatings were failing to inhibit although the nature

    of the corrosion product was somewhat different in the two cases.

    Nevertheless some degree of reduction in corrosion rate, based on R<sub>n</sub>

    beyond that shown by the unpigmented epoxy, was evident. Results for the red

    lead coating are shown in Figure 5. When immersed in 10% Harrison�s

    solution this system was not very effectively in providing inhibition, as

    shown by the ferricyanide test and low R<sub>n</sub> values. However when

    pre-soaked for 96 h in water and then transferred to Harrison�s solution,

    it maintained a sustained high value of R<sub>n</sub> and no visible

    corrosion was seen at the scribe. This graph also shows that when the

    Harrison�s solution was increased to 55% of full strength this overwhelmed

    the inhibitor and visible corrosion ensued along with a drop in the R<sub>n</sub>

    value to the levels of the non-inhibiting situation. Figure 6 shows a

    comparison of R<sub>n </sub>value between red lead and the CM and RH

    coatings. After a 24h soak in de-mineralised water the latter two primers

    failed to afford much long-term (more than 24 h) protection at the scribe.

    However (as already seen in figure 5) the red lead maintained a high R<sub>n</sub>

    value.</p>

    <h4>SRET</h4>

    <SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>SRET is able to provide a spatially resolved measurement of

    electrochemical activity at pre-selected intervals over a given period of

    immersion. Note that although results given here are only for single

    specimens, the effects described were reproducible i.e. very similar results

    were obtained when they were rescribed and reimmersed and also from second,

    nominally identical specimens. The region of the scratch is shown in Figure

    7. Some qualitative results obtained for the CM coating in 10% Harrison's

    are shown in Figure 8. The green areas indicate anodic activity. It can be

    seen that there is initial anodic activity in the centre of the scribe but

    this decreases within 4h. If the specimen is re-scribed (after 24h) this

    anodic activity recommences along the whole scribe but then falls away to

    almost zero after 10 days (by this time there is some red corrosion product

    visible in the base of the scribe). Results for RH coating are similar (see

    Figure 9). However there is a greater degree of electrochemical activity

    overall which agrees with the ENM results. Although after 10 days this has

    diminished, there was a quite voluminous yellow corrosion product visible in

    the scribe of the RH coated specimen.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>The effect of a short pre-soak for the CM coating was also investigated

    and the results are shown in a timed sequence over a period of some 24 h in

    Figure 10 and 11. These results are presented in black and white where the

    shade of grey corresponds to a probe output value in mV. Note the darker the

    shade the higher the current density.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Although both sequences were obtained with CM specimens in 10% Harrison's

    solution, the results in Figure 10 were obtained after preliminary immersion

    in de-mineralised (DM) water for 2-3 h whereas those shown in Figure 11 were

    obtained after immediate immersion in Harrison�s solution. Corrosion can

    be seen to increase/decrease over 24h and corresponds approximately with the

    R<sub>n</sub> results for the CM coatings as shown in Figure 2. However note

    that there is somewhat decreased activity overall in the pre-soaked sample

    showing that (as with red lead) there is some advantage in a pre-soak with

    the CM coating. It should be noted that the electrochemical noise and

    ferricyanide test results indicated that pre-immersion did not apparently

    cause any long-term decrease in corrosion. However the greater sensitivity

    of the SRET shows there is some effect at least in the early stages.</p>

    <h3>Conclusions and Further Work</h3>

    <ul>

      <li>Results obtained using the Electrochemical Noise Method have been able

        to indicate the level of protection afforded by a coating at a scribe.

        It would appear that a R<sub>n</sub> value of about 2 - 4.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>

        is necessary for effective inhibition on a 0.02cm<sup>2</sup> area in

        10% Harrison's solution. This translates to a value of about 4 x 10<sup>4</sup>

        to 9 x 10<sup>4 </sup>ohms-cm<sup>2</sup> i.e. somewhat lower than the

        Bacon, Smith and Rugg criteria [15] for a protective intact coating of 1

        x 10<sup>6</sup> ohms-cm<sup>2</sup>).&nbsp;</li>

      <li>Results show that the CM and RH coatings provide partial inhibition

        after about the first 24 hours where the CM coating appears more

        effective than RH coating for immersion in 10% Harrison's solution. Red

        lead is effective but requires a pre-soak in de-mineralised water in the

        absence of a top-coat.</li>

      <li>The Scanning Reference Electrode Technique has proved useful in

        providing direct evidence of electrochemical activity. The technique is

        very sensitive and can provide both quantitative and spatial

        information. The anodic/cathodic activity along the scribe over a period

        of 24�48 hours as indicated by SRET illustrated the effectiveness in

        retarding corrosion, of a coating containing active pigments.</li>

      <li>In this work the effect of a pre-soak in de-mineralised water was

        successfully investigated using both ENM and SRET. Hence using these two

        methods in combination, the effect of different environments e.g. de-mineralised

        water, 10% Harrison�s solution and 3% NaCl can be easily investigated.</li>

      <li>Further work is currently being conducted with top-coated systems to

        assess whether the effects observed here (particularly the effect of

        pre-soak) will still pertain.&nbsp;</li>
