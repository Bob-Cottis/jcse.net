<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>A clear commercial epoxy-powder lacquer, has been applied by electrostatic

spray onto mild steel panels and cured at 235&deg;C at a film thickness of 100

&mu;m. Coatings were tested in alkaline environments of mainly pH 13.2.

Assessment was by exposure at open circuit where delamination rates were

measured as a function of time. Variations in cation and cation concentration

and the presence or absence of chloride were studied. Delamination mechanisms

have been proposed.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>This paper is part of a study of epoxy-coated rebar steel in concrete. In

  continuation of previous work [1], investigations were made at open circuit,

  using a clear epoxy powder on mild steel panels in various alkali

  environments. Variations in specific cation, pH and presence of chloride were

  examined. The mechanisms of adhesion loss are investigated.</p>

  <b>

  <h3>Experimental</h3>

  </b>

  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Cold-rolled mild steel Q-Panels, 1 mm thick, were degreased by washing in

  detergent solution, rinsing well in de-ionised water and then spraying with

  ethanol. Pigment-free epoxy powder was supplied by Akzo Nobel Powder Coatings.

  The panels were heated in an oven, such that when they were removed and the

  epoxy powder sprayed onto them they would be in the temperature range 235-240<sup>o</sup>C,

  a requirement of the coating for its curing.. A Gema Volstatic manual

  fluidised bed powder system and PG1 powder gun was used to achieve a powder

  coating thickness within the range 100 � 10 �m. Panels with obvious defects

  in the powder coating were not used. A 3.0mm diameter holiday was introduced

  into the epoxy coating by means of a flat-head drill bit such that the Q-panel

  steel was exposed. As an alternative to the 3mm holiday, a pinhole was

  introduced to some specimens.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Test cells were then created by adhering a perspex tube of 5 cm diameter

  and 6 cm nominal height to the epoxy-coated panel, such that the artificial

  holiday was at its centre. Adhesion was achieved with the sparing use of

  silicone sealant.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>The test solutions used are shown in Table 1. The composition of the

  simulated pore solution was 0.3N KOH + 0.05N NaOH + 0.02N Ca(OH)<sub>2,</sub>

  suggested by Schiessl and Reuter [2]. Testing was at open circuit with a

  minimum of three panels used for each exposure condition. The pHs of the

  solutions were measured daily and adjusted as necessary. Delamination rate

  (apparent by a lighter or occasionally darker halo of delaminated coating) and

  half-cell potential measurements were made.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>The effect of the addition of 0.6M chloride to the solutions that FBE-coated

  panels were exposed to is shown in Figure 3. The potentials of all the panels

  became more negative, in the region of &#150;400 to &#150;550mV. The exposed

  substrate at the artificial holiday tended to remain bright and untarnished.

  Blue deposits began to appear underneath the coating adjacent to the holiday.

  At the edges of the artificial holidays, red deposits appeared, these

  observations strongly suggesting that corrosion was occurring. The presence of

  a region of bright visibly uncorroded substrate adjacent to and at the

  delamination front suggests that delamination of the FBE coating from its

  substrate was not being caused by anodic undermining. Closer examination by

  SEM confirmed that there was no visual evidence of substrate degradation there

  in either passive or corroding systems (Figures 4 and 5).</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p><b>Figure 5: Morphology of Q-Panel Substrate Beneath Delaminated Coating

  (Corroding System)</b></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>The presence of a cathode region at the coating/substrate disbondment front

  has been widely reported previously by many authors [3-12], and is often an

  implicit and sometimes explicitly stated part of their postulated coating

  delamination mechanism. Potential/time data shows that corrosion of the FBE-coated

  panels initiates soon after they are placed in the test solutions containing

  chloride ions. The corrosion process does not take place on the exposed mild

  steel substrate of the holiday, but is seen to develop at its edge. A Tafel

  plot of substrate potential/current response in pore solution can be seen to

  be virtually identical in comparison with pore solution with chloride (Figure

  6). Only when the bond between the mild steel test specimen and its

  encapsulating epoxy araldite resin is poor does evidence of crevice corrosion

  appear. It is suggested that corrosion initiates in a crevice between the FBE-coating

  and mild steel substrate, caused by the passive current density on the steel.</p>

  <p><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image292.gif" WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="327"></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p><b>Figure 6:Tafel Plots Illustrating the Effect of Poor Polymer Adhesion</b></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>The delamination data derived for each exposure condition was averaged.

  These values are plotted in Figure 7, where the average radial delamination of

  the panel is plotted against the square root of the time of its exposure to

  the test solution. A linear relationship is found using these axes for both

  passive and corroding systems (Table 2). Data for panels exposed to pH 12.0

  KOH solution is not plotted because no delamination could be found after 6

  months testing.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p>This parabolic delamination shows that rate of FBE disbondment is greatest

  upon its initiation, decreasing with time until a theoretical cessation of

  disbondment at infinity. More importantly from a mechanistic viewpoint, this

  relationship indicates that the rate-determining process is along the coating

  / substrate interface from the coating holiday. This relationship has also

  been found for coated systems corroding at open circuit by other workers

  [10,11,14]. If transport of this delamination parameter was through the

  coating, then a linear relationship between radial delamination and time of

  immersion would be encountered.</p>

  <p><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image293.gif" WIDTH="438" HEIGHT="399"></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p><b>Figure 7: Effect of Test Solution on Delamination of FBE-Panels</b></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>Referral to Table 2 informs us that delamination rates in corroding systems

  tend to be greater than those in passive. It is therefore likely that the

  rate-determining step in the delamination process of corroding and passive

  systems will be different.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>The FBE-panels which were exposed to passivating solutions at open circuit

  underwent delamination. The only electrochemical reactions which took place on

  their substrates in these conditions would have been the small passive current

  derived from the formation and dissolution of the substrate surface oxide

  film. It is therefore unlikely that the cause of delamination was an

  electrochemical process.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>When the delamination rate constants of the FBE-panels are plotted on a log<sub>10</sub>

  scale against the respective pHs of the passivating test solutions that they

  were exposed to, a linear relationship is derived (Figure 8). Concentration of

  hydroxyl ions in solution is therefore directly proportional to the rate of

  FBE coating delamination, and the rate-controlling step in the delamination

  process is the passage of hydroxyl ions along the coating/substrate interface.

  This information indicates that it is these hydroxyl ions which are directly

  responsible for coating delamination. It is possible that this relationship is

  due to the increasingly alkaline environments affecting acid-base interactions

  between coating and substrate, and hence polymer adsorption and adhesion, as

  suggested by Fowkes and Mostafa [15].</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p>Extrapolation of the pH / K<sub>d</sub> graph to the point of zero

  delamination rate constant correlates with a bulk solution pH of approximately

  13.0. This value will be associated with the minimum pH required to cause

  disbondment in the FBE / substrate system. At pHs below 13.0 there should

  therefore be no delamination. It has been shown that there was no delamination

  of coating from an FBE-panel after 6 months of exposure to a pH 12.0 solution.

  These observations suggest that the disbondment mechanism is unlikely to be

  either the chemical disruption of the polymer / metal oxide bonds by the

  presence of polar water molecules or through creation of a hydrodynamical

  stress on the bonds, as suggested by Funke [16]. If the disbondment mechanism

  were related to hydrodynamical stress on the bonds, then increasing solution

  osmotic pressure would be expected to result in a decrease in delamination

  rate. It has been shown that delamination will occur at pHs greater than

  approximately 13.0; the proposed oxide dissolution delamination mechanism

  proposed by Ritter and his co-workers [6,17-19] is therefore unlikely to be

  the cause of this delamination because it will not be thermodynamically viable

  at a pH of 13.2 [20]. That the relationship between pH and K<sub>d</sub> is

  linear is of interest, since this means that K<sub>d</sub> is proportional to

  the logarithm of hydroxyl ion concentration in solution. The delamination

  mechanism is therefore not a simple one; hydroxyl ions are not involved in a

  {1 hydroxyl ion : 1 coating/substrate adhesive bond disrupted} relationship.

  It is therefore unlikely that delamination of the FBE coating ion is caused by

  its saponification.</p>

  predominantly due to hydroxyl ions. The estimated pHs are shown in Table 3

  <SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p><b>Table 3: Solution pHs at the Delamination Front for Different Cations in

  Corroding Non-Chromated FBE-Panels Estimated from pH-Induced Delamination Data</b></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p>These pHs are less than those attainable by the cation hydroxides at

  saturation. The rate-controlling step in the delamination process of corroding

  FBE-coated panels is therefore the passage of the hydrated cations through the

  holiday and along the coating/substrate interface to the cathodic site. The

  cations are being transported to the cathode such that charge balance may be

  achieved.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT><p>It may noted from the derived linear relationship of Figure 9 that no

  delamination should take place if the cations present in solution have an

  absolute ionic mobility of or below approximately 1.6 x 10<sup>8</sup>m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>.

  An explanation for this observation may be made by consideration of the

  important factors responsible for maintenance of a high pH at the disbondment

  front. In the corroding underfilm system, the pH at the disbondment front will

  be controlled by the rate at which cations are transported to the cathode site

  and their maximum attainable pH, <i>and</i> the rate at which hydroxyl ions

  are transported away from it. From the pH / delamination rate constant data

  recorded for non-corroding non-chromated FBE-Panel systems it may be seen that

  below a given pH, delamination will not take place. It may be postulated from

  Figure 8 that this pH is also that which would be generated at the

  delamination front by a cation of absolute mobility 1.6 x 10<sup>8</sup>m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>.

  At cationic mobilities at or below this value the flux of hydroxyl ions away

  from the disbonding front would be too great for generation of a sufficiently

  high pH to cause delamination.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT><p>From SEM analysis it has been seen that disbondment does not leave visible

  coating on the steel panel substrate (Figures 4 and 5). The FBE-resin is

  already intimately mixed with its hardener in its powder form prior to

  spraying onto the heated panel, and its gel time occurs in a matter of seconds

  [24]. There is therefore no time for a separation of resin and hardener to

  take place, as has been suggested for solvent-based paint systems [25]. The

  FBE coating should therefore approximate the same chemical and structural

  composition from the outer limit of the polymer / substrate interphasial

  region to its external surface. In this situation, if the mechanism of

  adhesion loss was coating degradation and cohesive failure, then it would be

  equally likely to occur at any depth of the FBE coating on the passive

  specimens at open circuit. Failure always appeared to occur at or near the

  coating / substrate interface, i.e. in the interfacial or interphasial region,

  so these mechanisms were not the cause of disbondment.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(35)</SCRIPT><p>From the radial delamination / square root of time graph a delay time

  before delamination begins to occur is seen, as found by other researchers

  including Leidheiser and co-workers [21,26] and Sharman, Sykes and Handyside

  [14]. This is independent of both hydrated cation mobility and solution pH

  (Figures 11 and 12).</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(37)</SCRIPT><p><b>Figure 12: Effect of Solution pH on Delay Time of FBE-Panels in

  Passivating Solution</b></p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(38)</SCRIPT><p>Leidheiser, Wang and Igetoft [21] linked delay time to ion ingress into the

  coating, and Wang [27] to water diffusion through it. The differing delay

  times of the corroding systems cannot be explained in terms of an interfacial

  attack process from the holiday at the coating / substrate interface. If this

  was the important determinant, then delay times should be very similar because

  the samples exposed to chloride started to corrode after approximately the

  same period of immersion. Delay time may therefore be related to a transport

  process through the FBE-coating. There is no evidence that it is related to

  cationic transport, so this delay time is probably a function of either water

  or oxygen transport. Mayne [28] has shown that oxygen transport through a

  coating is a relatively rapid process, and Cottis [29] has stated that a

  typical oxygen permeability of an epoxy resin is 5.2 x 10<sup>-12</sup> mole.m<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>atm<sup>-1</sup>,

  so it is unlikely that this factor could account for the length of delay time

  recorded in these conditions (typically 3-4 days<sup>�</sup>). It is

  therefore possible that the delay time of the corroding system at open circuit

  is related to water transport through the coating.</p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <SCRIPT>comment(39)</SCRIPT><p>The following conclusions may be drawn from this investigation into

  delamination of FBE-coatings in alkaline environments:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Delay time before initiation of observable delamination processes may be

      a function of water penetration through the coating to the interfacial or

      interphasial coating/substrate region.</li>

    <li>Delamination of FBE coatings from steel substrates is predominantly

      caused by hydroxyl ions.</li>

    <li>Rate of FBE delamination is controlled by transport processes from a

      pore in the coating and along the delaminated coating/substrate interface

      to the disbondment front.</li>

    <li>The locus of failure of coating adhesion is in the interfacial or

      interphasial coating/substrate region.</li>

    <li>The rate of FBE delamination in near-passive conditions is controlled by

      hydroxyl ion migration from the bulk external solution to the

      coating/substrate disbondment front.</li>

    <li>The rate of FBE delamination in the condition of underfilm corrosion is

      controlled by hydrated cation movement to the cathode site.</li>

  </ul>
