<p align=left>An electrochemical
method has been used for the evaluation of anti-corrosive properties of coatings
on metals based on an under-film corrosion tester and using a current
interrupter technique.� The data
obtained from the under-film corrosion tester has been compared with data
obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. �It was found that where comparison was
possible a reasonable co-relation existed.�
The maximum value measurable in case of film resistance for the current
interrupter was 10<sup>10 </sup>&#937;cm<sup>
2</sup>and for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 5X10<sup>8</sup>&#937;cm<sup>2
</sup>respectably. The current interrupter method gave more parameters than
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and this makes this method more useful
not only for assessing anti-corrosive performance but also for the study of
corrosion mechanisms.</p>

<h3 align=left>Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Electrochemical methods
have long been studied for the quantitative analysis of degradation of coated
metals.[1]. A current interrupter technique has been developed for measuring
under-film corrosion which gives the same parameters as electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy.[2]� A comparison
of the data obtained from the current interrupter technique and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy will be described. A comparison between these two
methods clearly indicates those parameters which relate to film performance.</p>

<h3 align=left>Experimental</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p align=left>A clear alkyd (La), a
lead cyanamide pigmented alkyd paint(La-P) and a lead cyanamide pigmented
epoxy(Ep-P) were used as the paint samples for evaluation.� Mild steel(JIS G 3141) was used as a
substrate. The substrate was coated with the paints after surface treatment by
degreasing with xylene, abrading by emery paper (#240) and degreasing again with
xylene.� The paints were then spray coated.� Dry film thicknesses of 20�m, 60�m, 100�m
and 150�m were obtained for each paint. Sodium chloride solution (3 wt%) was
used as a test solution. For impedance spectroscopy (EIS) the surface area of
8.55 cm<sup>2� </sup>of coated panels
was used as a working electrode.� A
platinum electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as a counter electrode and a
reference electrode respectively.�
Measurements were carried out using a potentiostat (Tohogiken Model
2000), a frequency response analyzer (NF Model 5020) and PC(NEC PC-9801).� Frequencies were in the range of 20 kHz to
10 mHz and the applied potential was 9.0 mV(RMS). For the Current Interrupter
method (CI) the working electrode was same as that in the measurement of
impedance.� A platinum electrode and
Ag/AgCl electrode were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode
respectively as well. Measurements were carried out using a current interrupter,
(Under-film Corrosion Tester developed by DNT and Hokuto Denko Co.) </p>

<h3 align=left>Results and discussion</h3>

<h4 align=left>Parameters obtained by
electrochemical measurements</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Both electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and current interrupter were expected to give parameters
of natural potential (E), film resistance(Rf), film capacitance(Cf), charge
transfer resistance (Rct) and double layer capacitance (Cdl).� These parameters were used to evaluate the protective
properties of the coated steel.� The
suffix 1 and 2 mean parameters for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and
current interrupter method respectively.�
For example, Rf<sub>1 </sub>means film resistance obtained from electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and E<sub>2</sub> means potential obtained from the current
interrupter method. </p>

<h4 align=left>Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Measurements by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out for coated specimens.
Parameters Rf<sub>1,</sub>, Cf<sub>1</sub>, Rct<sub>1</sub>, Cdl<sub>1</sub>
and E<sub>1� </sub>were extracted where
possible from the data.� In case of non-degraded
coated specimen Rct<sub>1</sub>, and Cdl<sub>1</sub> were not detected.� Even in the case of degraded coated specimens,
a stable response was not found especially at low frequencies.� Therefore it was impossible to obtain Rct<sub>1</sub>
and Cdl<sub>1</sub>. Cf<sub>1 </sub>was calculated from the frequency at
maximum phase at high frequency. But in many cases when Cf<sub>1 </sub>was obtained
it did not change with time.�
Furthermore, impedance derived by extrapolation of the straight line of
gradient �1 at 1 Hz in Bode diagram and impedance derived by the frequency of
the top of Cole-Cole plot was attempted.�
E<sub>1</sub> varied with time.�
From this data, film resistance was the only parameter which showed less
scatter and was the only possible parameter which could be used for evaluating
protective performance.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The change of Rf<sub>1 </sub>with
time measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was shown in Fig.1. [15]� </p>

and E-P in 3%NaCl at room temperature<SCRIPT>ifscreenclick()</SCRIPT></b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Rf<sub>1 </sub>of clear
alkyd paint (La) coated steel stayed constant until 650h of immersion and thereafter
it decreased abruptled.� The film
resistance of coated steel with both alkyd paint (La-P) and epoxy paint (Ep-P) gradually
decreased and the epoxy paint always showed a higher value.�� In this test, the dependence of film
thickness of cyanamide alkyd paint (La-P) was assessed. It was not possible to
measure cyanamide alkyd paint (La-P) at greater than 60�m film thickness by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy even after 720 hours immersion. This is
probably due to high film resistance.</p>

<h4 align=left>Current interrupter (CI)</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Similar coated panels as
measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used for the measurement
by the current interrupter method. Decay curves measured by the current
interrupter are shown in Fig.2[15] </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The results are highly
encouraging �and the influence of film
thickness is clear for �each
parameter.� A similar tendency was
obtained in case of coated panels of both the clear alkyd (La) and epoxy �(Ep-P).��
The results of film resistance Rf<sub>2</sub> of the cyanamide alkyd
paint (La-P) with time by the current interrupter method is shown in Fig. 3a and
was more complete than that shown in the case of electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy.� </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Results were obtained
even in excess of 60 �m and up to 150 �m in film thickness by the current
interrupter whereas only the case of 20 �m film thickness were measurements possible
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p align=left>As well it was possible
to measure the higher film resistance, Rf<sub>2</sub> at an earlier period of
immersion by the current interrupter. It was impossible for electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy to measure the film resistance of coated steel in excess
of 5 x10<sup>8</sup> &#937;cm<sup>2</sup> .����� </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The rapid change of film
capacitance of cyanamide alkyd paint (La-P) with time occurred at 24 hrs., 840
hrs. and� 4000 hrs. for 20 &#956;m, 60 &#956;m,
100 &#956;m film thickness respectively as shown in Fig.3b.� The change of film capacitance was not
observed in case of 150 &#956;m in film thickness during the test period of
8000 hrs.� Generally it is understood
that the increase of film capacitance means the increase of water
absorption.� Then it is thought that
rapid increase of film capacitance indicates the increase of water absorption
due to either film degradation or under-film corrosion.� So it is thought that the film capacitance
Cf<sub>2� </sub>is an appropriate
parameter to judge the film degradation and under-film corrosion. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The charge transfer
resistance Rct<sub>2</sub> is a parameter determined by the resistance of
electrode reaction which gives information on the coating-metal interface. Corrosion
rate was derived from the Stern-Geary equation using the charge transfer
resistance by one of authors.[4]� The
decrease of charge transfer resistance Rct<sub>2</sub> is thought to mean the increase
in the electrode reaction processes, that is, the increase of corrosion rate from
which the degree of under film corrosion may be estimated.� The change of charge transfer resistance Rct<sub>2</sub>
with time is shown in Fig. 3c.��� The
change of charge transfer with time showed similar behaviour to that of film
resistance, from which it is suggested there is a close relationship between
them.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The double layer
capacitance Cdl<sub>2</sub> gives the information on metal interface under
paint film as well as the charge transfer resistance. The change of double
layer capacitance with time was shown in Fig. 3d and it is thought that the the
corrosion process can be detected with this parameter. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Finally the change of
natural potential E<sub>2</sub> with time was shown in Fig. 3e.��� In general, the thicker the film, the more
noble the natural potential.�� A
particularly noble potential can be seen at 7000 hrs. in case of 150 �m.�� The potential decreased gradually in case
of 60 �m and 100 �m in film thickness respectively.�� The final potential when visible degradation appeared on the
coated panel was around �550 mV vs. Ag/AgCl.</p>

<h4 align=left>Correlation between the impedance
and current interrupter methods</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Figure 4 shows the clear
correlation between film resistances Rf<sub>1</sub>, Rf<sub>2 </sub>measured by
the two methods up to about 5 x 10<sup>8 </sup>&#937; cm<sup>2</sup> . </p>

<p align=left><a href="v2p20f4.gif"><img border="0" src="v2p20f4.gif" width="500" height="459"></a></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p align=left><b>Figure 4 Correlation between film resistances 
determined by EIS and CI <SCRIPT>ifscreenclick()</SCRIPT></b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Indeed the limit for
measurement by EIS was confirmed as about 5 x 10<sup>8</sup> &#937; cm<sup>2</sup>and
CI methods at about 10<sup>10</sup> &#937; cm<sup>2</sup> respectively under
the same conditions for measurement.� It is thought that the reason why the difference come is
mainly depends on principle of measurement in spite of the influence of their
own instrument performance.� That is, it
is thought that current interrupter method is more effective and applicable to
the coated panel of higher resistance film because of simplified measurement
based on analysis of the decay curve after application of small DC current for
transient phenomena of polarization.�� </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Whereas EIS is
the measurement method which measures impedance at the specific range of
frequency by applying small AC current.�
</p>

<h4 align=left>Parameters measured by
current interrupter method</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><p align=left>It was found that more
and more precise data were obtained by the current interrupter method compared
to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p align=left>The parameters of E<sub>2</sub>,
Rf<sub>2</sub>, Cf<sub>2</sub>, Rct<sub>2 </sub>and Cdl<sub>2 </sub>which were
obtained by the current interrupter method can be seen in Figure 5[15] </p>

<p align=left><a href="v2p20f5.gif"><img border="0" src="../../volume2/paper20/v2p20f5.gif" width="500" height="224"></a></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p align=left><b>Figure 5 Correlation between various 
parameters obtained by the CI method <SCRIPT>ifscreenclick()</SCRIPT></b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Though the linear
relation was not obtained from the relationship between coating film resistance
(Rf<sub>2</sub>) and coating film capacitance (Cf<sub>2</sub>)in the
initial stage, the relation was obtained below about 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7
</sup>&#937; cm<sup>2</sup> which was measured after the initial test
period.� There was correlation between
coating film resistance Rf<sub>2</sub> and charge-transfer resistance Rct<sub>2</sub>.Also
there is a close correlation between film degradation and observed under-film
corrosion. A rapid increase of film capacitance Cf<sub>2</sub> was observed
after the rapid increase of double layer capacitance in every coated panel Cdl<sub>2</sub>
shown in Fig.5c. Then both capacitance increased linearly at the same time as blisters
appeared. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(29)</SCRIPT><p align=left>These results indicate
that the current interrupter method generates more parameters and that it may be
useful for not only performance evaluation of paint film but also for analysis
of film degradation and detection of under-film corrosion.</p>

<h3 align=left>Conclusions</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Parameters obtained by
EIS and CI were compared in terms of evaluation of protective coating
performance.� The findings are as
follows.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p align=left>Where comparable data
could be obtained, parameters obtained from EIS and CI gave good correlation.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p align=left>EIS showed an upper
limit of 5 x 10<sup>8</sup> &#937;cm<sup>2</sup>and
CI 10<sup>10 </sup>�&#937; cm<sup>2</sup>
respectively under the same condition.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT><p align=left>More parameters were
available in case of CI which may be used not only for the evaluation of
protective coating performance but also the analysis of degradation mechanisms
of the paint films and the mechanisms of under-film corrosion.</p>
