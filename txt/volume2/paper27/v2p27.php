  <p>The use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy to make short-term
  predictions of the long-term performance of internally coated 2-piece food
  cans has been explored. In particular, the effects of thermal processing and
  of product on the electrochemical and corrosion performance of filled can
  variables have been investigated. It has been found necessary to use different
  parameters derived from Equivalent Circuit analysis to predict specific
  corrosion processes. Although the relative performance of different
  experimental variables can be predicted using comparatively short-term
  impedance tests, the power of the methodology was limited by the sensitivity
  of the data to the inherent variability between replicate samples.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>The metal packaging industry makes extensive use of organic lacquer
  coatings to provide internal protection against corrosion of the metallic
  substrates (tinplate, tin-free steel, and aluminium) by the contents of the
  can. Recent developments, such as the requirement to change from solvent-based
  to water-based internal coatings to satisfy environmental legislation and the
  constant pressure to reduce raw material costs have led to renewed focus on
  the performance of these coatings. Traditional methods of assessing coating
  performance involve long-term storage tests which are expensive to set up, and
  are, by their very nature, time-consuming. Much effort has been expended in
  trying to develop reliable predictive tests to allow the more rapid
  introduction of new coatings into commercial use whilst maintaining confidence
  in their long-term performance.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy has, for a number of years, been
  regarded as the method of choice for investigating the behaviour of
  polymer-coated metals in contact with aqueous electrolyte systems. A number of
  papers have been published reporting its application to packaging systems
  [References 1-9 give a small selection of the published literature]. This
  paper describes some of the work carried out at Crown Cork &amp; Seal on the
  use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) as a predictive test of
  coating performance, relating both some of the successes so far, and some of
  the challenges which remain.</p>
  <h3>General Experimental Considerations</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>A number of experimental configurations have been employed in this work on
  lacquered containers, but typically, a three electrode system has been used,
  with the container as working electrode, a platinized titanium gauze counter
  electrode and either an anodised silver wire or an M/10 calomel reference
  electrode. Packed cans are opened in the conventional manner immediately
  before testing, and the electrodes inserted through the opening. This,
  however, has the disadvantage of allowing oxygen ingress, so
  &quot;in-can&quot; electrodes have been developed, which are mounted in the
  can side wall prior to filling and processing. Graphite rod counter electrodes
  and silver wire reference electrodes are used in this case. However, this
  procedure can cause damage to areas of the internal coating adjacent to the
  electrode mounting points and inadequate sealing of the cut edge will result
  in additional initiation points for corrosion.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>All impedance measurements were carried out using a Solartron 1255
  Frequency Response Analyser with either a Solartron 1286 or 1287
  electrochemical interface. The equipment was computer controlled using
  in-house software, or more recently, ZPlot for Windows (Version 2.1, from
  Scribner Associates / Solartron). Equivalent circuit analysis was performed
  using EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT Version 3.96 or 3.99 (from Bernard A Boukamp,
  University of Twente), and more recently using ZView for Windows (Version
  2.1). The equivalent circuits found most appropriate were typically of the
  type illustrated in Figure 1, where n=0, 1, 2 or occasionally 3. Significantly
  better fits were obtained from equivalent circuit analysis if all capacitances
  in the equivalent circuits were treated as constant phase elements. In the
  case of the coating capacitance, the exponential factor was always close to
  unity, but significant deviations were often found for the exponential factor
  of the double layer capacitances. These are presumably caused by diffusion
  effects, but have so far not been successfully modelled using Warburg
  impedances.</p>
  <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>Many food products are subjected to a thermal sterilisation treatment
  (processing) immediately after filling, with between 15 minutes and 1.5 hours
  at 121 �C in a steam retort being a typical process, depending on the
  product. This has obvious implications for the performance of the internal
  coating, with electrolyte being forced into pores in the coating and
  initiating corrosion reactions. The effects of different processing times has
  been studied on 2-piece drawn and wall ironed tinplate food cans, internally
  spray coated with a water-based epoxy-phenolic coating. The cans were filled
  with a synthetic vegetable medium (10 g/L sodium chloride, 3 g/L citric acid
  monohydrate, 13.3 g/L tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, adjusted to pH 5.5), and
  processing at 121 �C in a laboratory retort for various lengths of time.
  Representative Bode magnitude plots are shown in Figure 2. There is an obvious
  decrease in impedance response on bringing the retort up to pressure, which is
  accompanied by a decrease in pore resistance. There is, however, no
  significant increase in coating capacitance, (calculated as a ratio of the
  values obtained after and before processing to allow for different initial
  values) Figure 3, which is considered indicative of filling of pores with
  electrolyte. At processing times beyond about 45 minutes there is a further
  decrease in the impedance magnitude and pore resistance (Figure 4 shows the
  average of the pore resistance measured after processing), together with a
  shift in the phase angle minimum and the onset of a rise in the coating
  capacitance. This is thought to be caused by water being absorbed into the
  coating, reaching the metal substrate, and initiating delamination, and is
  substantiated by the onset of visible blistering at about this time.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>These marked changes on processing are perhaps to be expected but enable us
  to gain an indication of the susceptibility of different lacquers to barrier
  degradation on processing. For example, the then standard solvent-based
  lacquer was tested against the best available water-based lacquer and two of
  its developmental precursors (all lacquers were epoxy-phenolic based). Cans
  were filled with 1% sodium chloride, and impedance spectra run before and
  after processing at 121 �C for 1 hour. The pore resistance and lacquer
  capacitance ratio data obtained are given in Table 1.</p>

  2.5 months room temperature storage, two distinct corrosion effects were

  NaCl and Processed for 1 hour at 121 �C, opened after 2.5 months.</b></p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>There is an obvious correlation between low pore resistance and severe
  localised rusting, and between general underfilm rusting and increases in
  lacquer capacitance on processing, the latter presumably due to high levels of
  electrolyte uptake. Thus for predictive purposes it is necessary to use
  specific parameters for predicting different modes of failure.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>This work was extended to &quot;real&quot; foodstuffs that are often used
  as model products in long-term storage tests. Chicken soup is typical of a
  wide range of fatty products, mushy peas are representative of products which
  often cause an under-lacquer staining of tin or iron sulphide and
  blackcurrants are used as a model for acidic products (pH <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  3). Foodcans (a total of 6 replicate cans per lacquer per product), internally
  coated with solvent-based and water-based epoxy-phenolic lacquers, were
  initially filled with 1% sodium chloride, left (open) to equilibrate for 24
  hours, and their EIS spectra recorded. This procedure was designed to allow an
  initial test of the consistency of the sample of cans with a simple,
  reproducible medium. The cans were then washed and dried, filled with the
  appropriate product, and processed under the conditions in Table 3: -</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>Impedance spectra were then recorded for all the can variables, using the
  product as electrolyte. The cans were emptied, washed and dried, and re-filled
  with 1% sodium chloride. After a further 24 hours equilibration time, the
  impedance spectra were re-recorded. The results obtained are quoted in Table
  4.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>In chicken soup, the results both from tests in the product and
  subsequently in 1% NaCl show that better performance should be obtained from
  the solvent-based lacquer, and this is indeed the case. When cans from a
  storage test run in conjunction with this exercise were opened after 2.5
  months, corrosion was observed only in the headspace (the area between the
  product fill level and the top of the can) and the water-based lacquer showed
  systematically more corrosion.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>At 2.5 months, the cans filled with blackcurrants show very little
  corrosion damage, and no systematic difference between the water and
  solvent-based variables. This is in line with the high values of pore
  resistance and comparatively small rises in lacquer capacitance observed when
  tests were performed &quot;in product&quot;. In addition, a high frequency
  feature was observed in the Nyquist plots, which is believed to be consistent
  with film formation over the whole can surface. This would explain why this
  product is rather less aggressive than would be expected given its low pH.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>The tests in mushy peas were complicated by the highly viscous, semi-solid
  nature of the product, and difficulty was experienced in removing the product
  from the cans, which may have resulted in some lacquer damage. However, the
  enormous increases in lacquer capacitances observed when re-tested in 1%
  sodium chloride indicate a high level of lacquer barrier degradation. After
  2.5 months storage, blushing (an opaque appearance caused by water uptake) was
  apparent on both water and solvent-based lacquers, in addition to severe
  headspace corrosion, which was more severe in the water-based variable. A
  small degree of sulphide staining was also present on the can base, to a
  similar extent for both variables.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p><b>Table 4. Impedance Data for Model Food Products packed in 2-piece Food
  Cans with Epoxy-phenolic Internal Lacquer. Based on 6 cans/Variable</b></p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p>One of the problems with this methodology is that opening cans prior to
  testing prevents the possibility of repeat measurements to monitor the
  longer-term behaviour. The approach of packing a large number of cans, and
  then opening a small sample of them for testing on each occasion (e.g. 1 day,
  1 week, 1 month, 3 months) is not ideal because of the inherent replicate
  sample variability [10]. To try to overcome these problems, in-can electrodes
  (as described in the Experimental Section) were fitted to cans prior to
  filling with chicken soup and processing. Again, 2-piece foodcans were used,
  with a water-based lacquer variable and solvent-based control. Impedance
  spectra were run after 1 day, 1 week and 1 month after filling (but not, on
  this occasion, prior to filling). The cans were stored at 35 �C for the first
  month, in order to accelerate corrosion reactions, then subsequently at 25 �C
  until opening 1 year after filling. Whilst no significant difference was
  predicted between the performance of the two lacquers (visual examination
  after 1 year indicated that the water-based lacquer actually performed
  slightly worse), it was possible to monitor the impedance response with time
  for individual cans, and predict comparatively good and bad performers.
  Figures 5 to 8 show the time dependence of the Bode plots of two cans coated
  internally with a solvent-based lacquer, filled with chicken soup. Can 1
  (Figures 5 &amp; 6) was a comparatively bad performer when examined on
  opening, whilst Can 3 (Figures 7 &amp; 8) was comparatively good. The major
  change appears to occur between 1 week and 1 month; the &quot;bad&quot; can
  shows a reduced low-frequency impedance magnitude, and the phase angle minimum
  at about 10Hz has disappeared. Examination of the time trends of the lacquer
  capacitance (Figure 9) shows that both cans display similar trends in lacquer
  capacitance, with Can 3 having a steeper initial fall and a steeper subsequent
  rise. It is not understood why the lacquer capacitance falls during the first
  few days of storage. Figure 10 shows the corresponding time dependence of the
  pore resistance, and it can be seen that Can 1 shows a greater decrease in
  pore resistance, particularly between 1 week and 1 month, as previously noted
  in the Bode plot.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>A recent study involved testing a range of three developmental white
  internal epoxy-phenolic lacquers for food can applications. The lacquers were
  applied at the same film weight (417<font face="Symbol">�</font> 60 mg/can)
  onto 2-piece food cans manufactured from tinplate with two internal tin
  coating weights (2.24 and 15.1 g/m�). This gave a total of 6 variables, as

  <SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p><b>Table 5. Coding of Variables for White Internal Lacquer Investigation</b></p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>Owing to the large number of samples in the experiment, it was not possible
  to use the in-can electrodes approach. Therefore the previously standard
  method of filling sufficient cans to enable batches of five to be tested at
  each time interval (initial, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after
  filling) was used. The initial tests were made on unprocessed cans, filled
  with 1% sodium chloride (the cans were allowed to equilibrate for two hours
  before testing). All other tests were made on samples taken from a batch which
  had been filled with chicken soup and processed for 90 minutes at 121 �C.
  Cans were opened and the reference and counter electrodes inserted immediately
  before running the impedance spectra. Figures 11 to 16 show the time
  dependence of the pore resistances and lacquer capacitances, grouped by
  lacquer type. The most striking observation is the degree of scatter within
  each variable, though in terms of pore resistance, the higher tin coating
  weight variables (H2, H4 and VC2) appear to be marginally better than their
  low coating weight counterparts with the same lacquer. As discussed
  previously, pore resistance and lacquer capacitance are indicators of the
  relative importance of different corrosion processes. Plotting one against the
  other should enable comparison of lacquers for both effects simultaneously,
  and, eventually, it should be possible to draw regions of &quot;acceptability
  and unacceptability&quot; on the graphs. Figures 17 and 18 show such graphs
  for the three variables with high tin coating weights at 1 day and 3 months.
  At first sight, they merely emphasise the experimental scatter, but
  differentiation becomes apparent in the 3 month&#146;s data, with variable H2
  shows higher pore resistance and H4 more susceptible to electrolyte uptake
  (higher lacquer capacitance ratios).</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT><p>Another approach is to examine the parameters directly related to the
  actual degree of corrosion, i.e. the charge transfer resistances [2]. Because
  typically two resistor / constant phase element combinations placed in series
  with each other have been used in the equivalent circuits, the two resistance
  values have been added to give an overall charge transfer resistance. Figure
  19 displays these data for the three variables with high tin coating weight.
  Some discrimination between variables is beginning to become apparent at 3
  months, but not before. A similar conclusion would be obtained by comparing
  the impedance magnitude at low frequency, because the pore resistances are
  small compared to the charge transfer resistances. The charge transfer data at
  1 month also reveal the superior performance of the high tin coating
  variables. This is shown in Figure 20 for lacquer A, the corresponding graphs
  for Lacquers B and C are not displayed, but are similar. The findings of these
  predictive tests have been borne out by the results of storage tests.</p>
  <h4>Conclusions</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><p>It has been demonstrated that: -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Relative performance of different experimental lacquer variables may be
      predicted using comparatively short term impedance tests.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Different impedance parameters need to be used for the prediction of
      different modes of failure. Lacquer capacitance, pore resistance and
      charge transfer resistance are all useful as predictors derived from
      equivalent circuit analysis; the low frequency impedance magnitude can
      also be used.<br>
    </li>
    <li>It is more desirable to conduct impedance tests using the food product
      as electrolyte.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The most severe changes in impedance parameters occur as a result of the
      necessary thermal processing of the cans; subsequent changes are
      comparatively slow.</li>
  </ul>
  <SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p>However, the following problems have been encountered: -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A high level of scatter within variables is typical, due to the inherent
      variability of commercial materials and processes. This may mask
      differences between variables.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The use of in-can electrodes to allow repeat measurements on a single
      can would be preferred, but experimental problems remain to be overcome<br>
    </li>
    <li>Differences in corrosion behaviour may not become apparent in the EIS
      parameters until some time after filling, which limits the predictive
      capability of the technique.</li>
