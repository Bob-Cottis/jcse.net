<p>Introduction</p>



<p>In early work on intact polystyrene

lacquers on mild steel immersed in sodium chloride solutions, Mayne [1] showed

that the corrosion under the lacquer was electrochemical with spacial

separation of anodic and cathodic areas.�

Cathodic reactions led to underfilm blistering, the blisters being

filled with sodium hydroxide solution.�

The anodic reaction was iron oxidation and iron ions were thought to

migrate across the film at regions where ionic induction was easier.� These easy conduction pathways were further

investigated by Mayne and his co-workers [2] and it was found that such areas

had ionic resistance values which decreased as the bathing solution

concentration increased and Mayne coined the term �D� area to stand for these

paths of easy conduction.� This early

work was concerned with unpigmented polymer lacquers but such �D� areas were

also observed with polymers pigmented with iron oxide [3] and zinc oxide

[4].� �D� areas were subsequently

correlated with underfilm corrosion with the classical study undertaken by

Mayne and Mills [5].</p>



<p>Since �D� areas were first proposed, there

has been many attempts to explain the presence of D areas in terms of polymer

structure and currently there are three likely explanations.� Firstly, most paints and organic polymer

films cure by a chemical reaction after application that cross links the

polymer to form a three dimensional network.�

This cross-linking reaction can either be driven by atmospheric oxygen

in the case of air-drying systems or by the reaction of two prepolymer

components that are mixed just before application in the case of 2-pack epoxy

systems.� In such a polymerisation

process, there will be a spread of cross linking density and one possible

explanation of �D� areas in regions of very low cross link density in the

polymer film.� This hypothesis was shown

to be true using a solvent-swelling technique in previously identified �D�

areas (6).</p>



<p>A second explanation of �D� areas may be

applied to polymers which carry polar side chains.� The most common example of such polymers used as the basis for

organic coatings is the air drying alkyd which has a high concentration of

fixed acid groups.� The explanation

involves a high concentration of polar groups which might aggregate around a

specific volume in the film and ion conduction would proceed more readily

through these �pipes�.� Correlation

between these features and conduction has been reported [7].</p>



<p>Shortly before his death, Mayne [8] had

been studying solvent-free epoxy systems and investigating the role of solvent

and solvent retention on coating performance in general and the presence of �D�

areas in particular.� He concluded that

�in the absence of solvents, the films have much higher electrolytic resistance

and a more homogenous structure consequently the elimination of solvents leads

to films of increased protective value�.</p>



<p>Such paths of easy ion conduction or �D�

areas are one of the most important features of a corrosion protective film and

the knowledge of their location and increase in number with time provides

useful information on the mechanism of breakdown.</p>



<p>In this study, a rapid, simple and low

cost AC driven probe was constructed to enable regions of high conductivity to

be quickly identified. Such a technique although uncommon in the laboratory,

has been used for many years for the identification of defects in coatings in

pipelines. [9]. </p>



<p>Experimental</p>



<p>The AC signal at 2HK<sub>z</sub> amplitude

2V from a signal generator was connected to the metal substrate.� The other connector from the signal

generator was fed through a resistor to a specially constructed probe.� The probe was a felt tipped pen where the

ink had been extracted with repeated flushing with methanol and replaced with

3% NaCl.� The detector was a cathode ray

oscilloscope across the resistor. The felt-tipped pen was gently moved manually

in the X and Y directions across the whole surface of the coated specimen.� Where conduction was negligible, there was

no response from the oscilloscope.�

Where there was detectable conduction, a characteristic signal was

observed on the oscilloscope. Paths of conduction were located on graph paper

photocopied onto transparent paper.</p>



<p>The coating used was a short oil alkyd

(linseed, china wood, phenolic-modified) which was used in three conditions;</p>



<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear unpigmented,</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; inert pigmented containing iron oxide and extenders, and </p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-corrosion, zinc chromate pigmented plus iron oxide and

extenders as b above.</p>



<p>The substrates were degreased cold-rolled

mild steel and a platinum foil reinforced on the back with a beeswax/colophony

resin mixture. Film application was by spreader bar achieving a dry film

thickness of 25-35&#956;m. Measurements were carried out dry and after

immersion in 3% NaCl solution. The film surface was blotted before carrying out

measurements. Visual observations were also carried out. Figure 1 shows the change in the number of conduction pathways for the various systems

studied. </p>

<p><b>Discussion</b></p>



<p>The first point to notice is that in all

cases there is an increase in the number of conduction pathways with time, some

slower and some faster. Initially, there are a few number, in the clear lacquer

less than ten, in the pigmented systems less than five. Within five days, these

regions had increased and this change is probably due to entry of water into

the film, Mayne's so called fast change.</p>



<p>�The second interesting feature of these data is that they are

grouped into three sets according to the pigmentation used in the coating. The

change in substrate from steel to platinum make no difference to the initial

behaviour with time. The greatest rate of change of number of spots occurs in

the unpigmented case, the next is the system with unreactive pigmentation, the slowest

is with the presence of the anti-corrosive, zinc chromate. </p>



<p>This clearly suggests that the process of

opening up of new pores is initially dependent on the coating system and not on

the substrate.</p>



<p>Thirdly, when the clear system is compared

with the two pigmented systems, there is a clear difference due to the presence

of pigments. There is a substantial improvement in the presence and growth of

pores comparing the clear system and the inert pigmented system. </p>



<p>In the non corroding substrates, that is

the platinum and the zinc chromate pigmented system on steel, the number of

conduction pathways level out at around sixty for the clear lacquer on

platinum, twenty five for the inert pigmented system on platinum, and around

ten for the zinc chromate system on both steel and platinum. The interesting

feature of these data is the fact that the presence of the zinc chromate seems

to be effecting the bulk properties of the coating as well as the interfacial

corrosion properties. It may be that the hexavalent chromium is acting as an

extra coating drier together with the normal transition metal driers that will

have been added to the coating formulation. This suggestion would need further

work to establish its validity.</p>



<p>Finally, the effect of substrate corrosion

in the growth of the conduction pathways is spectacular. In both the clear

lacquer on steel and the inert pigmented system on steel, the number of

pathways increased rapidly after corrosion was observed. Various suggestions

have been proposed [10] to explain how substrate corrosion can lead to dynamic

underfilm corrosion including the mechanical effects of corrosion products,

underfilm chemical effects and underfilm electrochemical effects.</p>



<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>



<p>An inexpensive device has been proposed

and constructed for detecting pores on polymer coated metals.</p>



<p>This device has been used to look at the

effects of pigmentation, both inert and anti-corrosive, on the corrosion of

coated mild steel and on platinum in 3% NaCl.</p>



<p>Significant differences were observed

which were related to the effects of pigmentation, substrate and the presence

of an anti-corrosive pigment.</p>



<p>A new mechanism of chromate inhibition in

an alkyd medium is proposed.</p>
