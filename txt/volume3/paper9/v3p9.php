<SCRIPT>notify();</SCRIPT><SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Inhibition effect of molybdate inhibitors in tap water has been studied
in this article, according to electrochemistry test. It is pointed out that
compatibility with molybdate can playcomparable
effect as benzotriazole. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><p><b>Key Words:</b> Electrochemistry, Molybdate, benzotriazole (BTA)</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>BTA was ever popular to copper material in industry application. Now, it
is seen that molybdate has gradually come into taking place of BTA, for BTA is
difficult to dissolve[<script>crossref(1)</script>].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>At present, it is very necessary to study molybdate as copper
inhibitor[<script>crossref(2)</script>]. This article mainly discussed inhibitive effect of molybdate and
made comparison between molybdate and traditional copper inhibitor (BTA) by
electrochemistry polarization and impedance test. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>All tests were carried out with PARC M283 potentiostat, 5210 type locked
amplifier made in EG&amp;G USA. The volume of electrochemistry test cell is 1L,
which is in accordance with ASTM standard. Electrode system are composed of
three parts---saturated calomel electrode as reference, carbon stick as aided
electrode (two stick placed symmetrically in order to diffuse electric current
evenly), copper as work electrode (area is 0.785 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>The measurements set the potential scanning rate at 1mV/sec for    
potentiodynamic tests. AC impedance measurements were carried out using a 5mV    
peak-to-peak sinusoidal modulation from 10mHz to 100KHz. A two-channel    
dynamic-signal analyser was used to obtain the impedance. All experiment were    
performed at room temperature (25�C) in deionized water (DD&lt;0.2&micro;s/cm), and    
immersion time in tap water before test is all set 2h for getting steady open    
circuit potential - E<sub>oc</sub>, which is useful and referenced in    
comparison of electrochemistry behaviour in measurement. </p>    

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><h3>Results and Discussion</h3> 

<p>In order to express clearly in figure and table, we use M, B to represent
molybdate and BTA respectively. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><h4>Polarization test of Molybdate</h4> 

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>Molybdate is an anodic inhibitor, and its oxidation is inferior to
chromate. Passivation may occur quickly if oxygen is enough, and a high
dosage of molybdate is needed if insufficient oxygen is available. Therefore, compatibility with chemicals
is the best way to develop efficient inhibitors.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>The experiments of molybdate used lonely included different 
concentration - 0, 10, 100, 200 and 1000 mg/L. Under aforesaid condition, we 
measured these tests, and gave the results in Table 1. </p> 

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>From table 1, when concentration of molybdate is less than 200  
mg/L, the  
relation between concentration of molybdate and inhibitive efficiency is  
linear. The more the concentration is, the more efficient the inhibitor plays.  
And the largest inhibitive efficiency is 66.4%. However, when concentration of  
molybdate reaches 1000 mg/L, inhibitive efficiency is less than that of 200 mg/L  
molybdate. Therefore, there is concentration limit effect in molybdate-containing 
solution.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>Shown in Fig. 1, we can
study polarization curve and indicate that the inhibitive effect of molybdate
is limited. Although there is obvious passivation tendency, passivation current
is not small enough to protect copper material efficiently.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><h4>Polarization 
Test of BTA</h4> 

<p>BTA(benzotriazole) is traditional copper inhibitor. We also paid much   
attention on BTA inhibitive effect in deionized water. BTA tests included 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500mg/L   
concentration. And parameter of polarization curve can be seen in Table 2.</p>   

<SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>From table 2, we can get the conclusion that BTA can be equivalent 
effect to molybdate as copper inhibitor when it is used lonely. And inhibitive 
efficiency can reach 67.8% when concentration of BTA is 200mg/L. Besides, 
when concentration of BTA is larger than 200mg/L, inhibitive effect is inferior 
to 200mg/L. This conclusion can be also demonstrated by polarization curve of 
BTA (10mg/L test) shown in Fig. 2.</p> 

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>However, BTA is difficult to dissolve.
Therefore, we studied the combination effect of molybdate and BTA. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>From Table 3 and Fig.3, when concentration of molybdate is 100 mg/L, the 
inhibitive effect is equivalent with molybdate or BTA used alone. But when 
concentration of molybdate is 200 mg/L, we can find that there is obvious change 
in inhibitive efficiency. Especially in the test that concentration ratio of 
molybdate and BTA 2:1, the inhibitive efficiency reaches 81.7%. There is 
obvious synergistic effect between molybdate and BTA, which indicates that it 
is beneficial for molybdate to use with BTA.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><h4>Impedance Test of compatibility

<p>Fig. 4 gives Bode phase spectrograph of the three tests for which the
concentration of molybdate is 200mg/L. When concentration of BTA is 100mg/L,
the phase angle peak reaches 63.0deg or so. And the corresponding frequency of
phase angle peak is in the range 10~100Hz, which is higher than test of
molybdate used as only inhibitor in solution. Therefore, impedance test can
prove that there is obvious synergistic effect between molybdate and BTA.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ol>
<SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT>  <li>Molybdate can be 
inhibitive to copper material in deionized water; molybdate used with BTA can 
play superior role in inhibitive property to BTA used lonely as copper 
inhibitor;</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT>  <li>The possible 
mechanism lies in that molybdate attends forming passivation material, which is 
steady and anti-corrosion. So, molybdate is useful and potential for industry 
usage.</li>
