<p>A composite coating, containing (wt%) 1.35RE, 5.46W, 4.82B, 15SiC and Ni can be
electrodeposited on the matrix by use of appropriate bath composition and
process parameters. The addition of RE can enhance the hardness and wear
resistance of the coating remarkably. The hardness and wear resistance of the
coating increase with a rise in heat treatment temperature, and the hardness
reaches the optimum value at 400&deg;C, while the coating has the best wear
resistance at 500&deg;C. The wearing tests show that the wear resistance of the
coating is 4~5 times as high as that of hard chromium, and the corrosion tests
indicate that the corrosion resistance of the coating is superior to that of
1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel in various corrosive media, except for nitric acid.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>Composite
materials are important new materials used today. Several materials with
different properties can be combined to form a new type of composite materials
to meet various requirements. Composite electrodeposition is a new
surface-strengthening process by which some inorganic or organic particles can
codeposit with metal or alloy to form composite coatings with many special
properties, such as wear resistance, high temperature oxidation resistance, corrosion
resistance and electrical contact function[1~6].</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>The
existing electrodeposited composite coatings are mostly based on nickel or
copper, e.g. Ni-SiC or Cu-SiC coatings. The wear resistance of these coatings is
higher than that of pure nickel or copper[7],but their corrosion resistance is
relatively poor. Another kind of composite coatings is obtained by electroless
plating ,e.g. Ni-P-SiC or Ni-B-SiC coatings[8~9].The hardness of these coatings
can be enhanced to 1100~1200Hv,and their wear resistance improved after
appropriate heat treatment, but the coating thickness is usually only 50~70um
and their wear resistance also poor. After many tests, a new composite coating
with higher hardness and better wear resistance is developed. The hardness of
this electrodeposited composite coating is 600~900Hv as-deposited, and can be
increased to 1400~1700Hv after heat treatment (400&deg;C x 1h).This process has
been applied to treat the parts of cigarette and textile machines.</p>

Results and discussion</h3>

<h4>3.1
Effect of Heat Treatment Temperature on Coating Hardness and Wear-resistance</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>The
relationship between the hardness of composite coating and the heat treatment
temperature is shown in Fig.1 . The coating hardness increases with a rise of
temperature and reaches the peak value at 400&deg;C . After that, the hardness
decreases as temperature increases. This is because that when the coating being
heated, the coating structure changes, and becomes oversaturated with respect to
nickel solid solution and the distortion in the crystal lattice gets serious so
that the coating hardness increases. Since a large number of Ni3B particles
appear and precipitation hardening occurs, the coating hardness reaches peak
value. With continuously increasing heat treated temperature, crystalline particles of nickel solid solution grow up and Ni3B particles� aggregate and coarsen and the composite
coating softens. It can be seen that the additions of RE increase the coating
hardness because RE can facilitate the codeposition of SiC particles and Ni-W-B
alloy and enhance the content of SiC particles in the coating. Furthermore,
Fig.1
also indicates that the coating microhardness increases with a rise in boron
content, the hardness of the plated coating is 650~850Hv and that after heat
treatment can reach 1400~1650Hv.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>As
shown in Fig.2, the abrasion rate of the composite coating without heat
treatment is the highest and decreases linearly with a rise in heat treatment
temperature until it reaches the lowest value at 500&deg;C. Although the coating
hardness is the highest at 400&deg;C , but at this temperature, the abrasion rate
is relatively large because the coating contains a lot of hydrogen, which makes
the coating internal stress high, and more brittle so that some cracks form in
the coating, and the coating drop out partially under the alternate stress
during abrasion test. When heated, the coating liberates the hydrogen, and the
stress and brittleness of the coating decrease. At 500&deg;C ,the coating hardness
is relatively high and the brittleness lower, so the wear resistance is the
best. At higher temperature, the crystal grains of nickel solid solution grow up
and Ni3B particles coarsen, so that the coating softens and its abrasion rate
increases. Moreover, Fig.2 shows that the coating wear resistance increases with
a rise in B content, and the additions of RE improve the wear resistance
remarkably.</p>

<h4>3.3
Comparison of Corrosion Resistance of Various Coatings</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>From
the self-corrosion potential data shown in Table 3, it can be seen that the
corrosion resistance of Ni-B base composite coating against sulfuric acid is
not as good as that of Ni-P base composite coating, but superior to those of
stainless steel and hard chromium coating.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>Fig.3
shows the corrosion experiment results of Ni-B base composite coating and Ni-P
base composite coating in 20%HCl. Evidently, the corrosion resistance of Ni-P
base composite coating is better than that of Ni-B base coating, and the
corrosion rate of Ni-B base coating is increased gradually, so the corrosion
resistance of Ni-B base coating against Cl- is far inferior to that of Ni-P
base coating.</p>

Conclusion</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(26)</SCRIPT><p>(1) The
structure of RE-Ni-W-B-SiC composite coating is affected by boron content and
heat treatment temperature. The coating as-deposited is in a thermodynamical
nonequilibrium state, and its structure is oversaturated solid solution when
boron content is low. With a rise in boron content the coating structure
transits gradually to amorphous state, and changes to equilibrium crystalline
state after heat treatment. At about 400&deg;C boride phase is precipitated.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p>(2) The
hardness of as-deposited RE-Ni-W-B-SiC coating is 600~800Hv, and it can reach
1400~1650 Hv after heat treatment (400&deg;C x 1h). The high hardness is attributed
to the combination strengthening of solid solution hardening and dispersion
hardening.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p>(3) The
corrosion resistance of RE-Ni-W-B-SiC coating is lower than that of Ni-W-P-SiC
composite coating, but higher than that of 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel.</p>
