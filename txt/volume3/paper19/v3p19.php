<p>The corrosion resistance and microstructure
of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub> refractories in smelting
reduction melts were studied and evaluated by the quasi-station immersion and
rotary immersion test. The corrosion rate of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-
ZrO<sub>2</sub> refractories is decreased with the addition of the graphite
carbon and ZrO<sub>2</sub>. The test results showed that the ZrO<sub>2 </sub>containing
bricks had much better corrosion resistance than the ZrO<sub>2</sub>-free
bricks. The ZrO<sub>2 </sub>addition improved the oxidization resistance of the
graphite carbon of the refractory and decreased the interaction rate between
the melts and the refractory. The corrosion mechanism of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub>
refractories is the interaction between melts and refractory and the
dissolution of the refractory constituents into the melts. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion resistance of the
refractories to the smelting reduction melts is one of the imperative problems
for the development of smelting reduction [<script>crossref(1)</script>-<script>crossref(3)</script>]. The composition and
oxidization behavior of the smelting reduction melts with iron bath are much
more complicated than that of the blast furnace technology [<script>crossref(4)</script>-<script>crossref(7)</script>]. The
properties of the melts are changed dynamically and constantly in the melting
process. The chemical properties of the melts depend greatly on the activity of
FeO and the reduction rate of iron oxides in the molten bath [<script>crossref(8)</script>-<script>crossref(9)</script>]. Due to the
high concentration FeO slag and high reduction rate of iron oxides in the
melts, the corrosion behavior and corrosion mechanism of the refractories in
smelting reduction melts are complicated in development of the smelting
reduction technology. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2 </sub>refractories
have been widely used in blast furnace, rotary furnace, electric-resistance
furnace[<script>crossref(10)</script>-<script>crossref(14)</script>]. It is imperative to investigate the corrosion mechanism of
different kind refractories in the melts of smelting reduction with iron bath,
control the corrosion reaction and decrease the corrosion rate of refractories
efficiently for the development of smelting reduction technology. This
investigation focused on studying the physical properties, corrosion behavior,
corrosion rate, and examining the microstructure change for the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C
-ZrO<sub>2</sub> based refractories.</p>

<h3>Experimental Process</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C and
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub> refractories were used in this
study. The composition and properties of refractories are listed in the table
1. The melts was composed of molten slag and iron bath. The composition of slag
is given in table 2. Slag specimens were made of the blast furnace slag (from
Chongqing Iron Making &amp; Steel Making Co.) and adjusted the composition with
chemical agents (Shanghai Chemical Agents Co.). Slag grain was made in advance
of immersion test by melting the mixture of the blast furnace slag and chemical
agents. The iron bath was formed by pig iron scrap (made from Chongqing Iron
Making &amp; Steel Making Co.). Its composition was (%wt): C 4.16, Si 0.53, Mn
0.32, P 0.10 and S 0.034. Before the testing, iron bath was saturated with
carbon used a graphite block on the bottom of the crucible at 1500 �C for 3
hours.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>Corrosion tests carried out with
rotary immersion and quasi-static immersion in electric resistance furnace
respectively. The specimen of refractory was immersed into bath 50mm. The
experimental temperature was designed between 1723K and 1923k. The composition
of the atmosphere in the molten bath was maintained CO 30%, N<sub>2 </sub>60%
and CO<sub>2</sub> 10% in volume. The solid grain slag was added in the
crucible after the iron scrap being melted. The refractory specimen was immersed
into melts when the temperature of the bath reached the designing level. The
examination of the corrosion behavior was by measuring the diameter change and
the mass loss of refractory specimen during the immersion test.</p>

<h4>Effect of Addition ZrO<sub>2</sub> in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C Based
Refractories</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The refractory brick containing
ZrO<sub>2</sub> has been widely used in high temperature furnace or kin.� But the condition in the melts of smelting
reduction with iron bath is much more complexity than other metallurgical
processes. The corrosion behavior of refractories in the melts of smelting
reduction with iron bath is different from that of blast furnace.� Table 3 was the test results of the
relationship between the corrosion rate and the ZrO<sub>2 </sub>content of
refractories. The test results show that the higher the ZrO<sub>2</sub> content
in refractory, the lower the corrosion rate of the refractories in smelting
reduction melts. ZrO<sub>2</sub> has a good quality corrosion resistance of
smelting reduction melts with iron bath.�
The reasonable content of ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub>
refractory is 6-9% approximately for smelting reduction technology. </p>

<h4>Influence of the Iron Oxides on Corrosion Rate</h4>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion behavior and the
mechanism for several kinds refractory in the melts of smelting reduction
technology have been investigated in detail. FeO concentration and activity are
the important factors that affect the corrosion behavior of refractories
[<script>crossref(2)</script>,<script>crossref(4)</script>,<script>crossref(6)</script>,<script>crossref(9)</script>]. A comparison test of study the relationship between FeO
concentration and corrosion rate is shown in figure 1. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p align="center"><b>Figure 1�� Test
results of the influence of FeO content in melts on the corrosion rate of the
refractories, test temperature is 1773k at the rotary immersion</b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion rate of refractory
is increased almost as a linear relationship with the FeO content in the
smelting reduction melts. The corrosion resistance of the refractories is
evident decreased as the FeO of the melts increasing. As the concentration
increasing in the melts, the oxidization rate of carbon graphite contained in
the refractory is increased. The graphite carbon contained in refractory will be
as a reduction agent and reduce FeO of the melts and produce metal Fe and
gaseous CO. The pores and cracks will be formed in reaction layer of
refractory. This effect will improve the kinetics of the corrosion process and
the rate of melts penetration refractory. The corrosion resistance of AZ
refractory is higher than that of AC refractory because ZrO<sub>2</sub>
exhibits a good anti-oxidization behavior. </p>

<p><b>Influence of
Temperature on the Corrosion Rate </b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 2 is the test results of corrosion rate of refractories
at the different test temperature. It is shown that the temperature of the
molten bath was one of the important factors that influence the corrosion
behavior of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C
basedrefractory.</p>

2:� Relationship between the temperature
of the melts and corrosion rate of refractory, with 8.5% FeO concentration of0
melts, rotary speed 20r/min.</b></p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion
rate of refractory was increased with an exactly linear relationship as the
temperature increasing. But the changing ratio of corrosion rate was less than
that of FeO concentration of melts. The moving rate of slag film and reaction
between the melts and refractories in ingredients of molten slag film will be
speeded up when the temperature is increased. On the other hand, increasing
molten bath temperature would speed up the mass diffusion in slag film, molten
melts and deteriorate layer of refractory. The reduction rate of FeO in melts
would also be increased and the stirring of the molten bath by the heat motion
and the gaseous CO produced in the reduction reaction would be fierce as the
temperature increasing.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The corrosion rate of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub>
refractories in the melts of smelting reduction with iron bath is decreased
with the addition of graphite carbon and ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the refractories.
The principal constituents of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C refractory are
composed of Corundum, Mullite, a-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3, </sub>andgraphite.
During the corrosion test, the interaction between melts and the refractory was
occurred and the new compounds of FeO.SiO<sub>2,</sub> FeO.3CaO, 2CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub>
and CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub> were formed in the deteriorate layer. The graphite
carbon has been oxidized over 90% and porosity is increased greatly in the
deteriorate layer of refractory. </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(1)</SCRIPT><p>The
corrosion behavior of AZ refractory was graphite and Zirconia was partially
disappeared, Zirconolite, CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>C and metal Fe
formed. The interaction between melts and the refractory formed some new
compounds of FeO.SiO<sub>2</sub> (the melting point 1205<sup>o</sup>C), SiZrO<sub>4</sub>,
FeO.3CaO, 2CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub> and CaO.SiO<sub>2</sub> in the deteriorate
layer. The corrosion mechanism of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-C-ZrO<sub>2</sub>
refractories is the interaction between melts and refractory and the
dissolution of the refractory constituents into the melts. </p>
