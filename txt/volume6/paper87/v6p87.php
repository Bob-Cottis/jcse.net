effect of temperature on metal dusting was investigated on Fe-26Al alloys           
(compositions are given in at. %). By thermogravimetric analysis it was found           
that the carburisation rate reaches its maximum at about 600 °C. With increasing           
temperature and with increasing aluminium content from 15 to 40 at. % the           
tendency of the formation of a protective aluminium oxide layer on Fe-Al alloys           
becomes stronger. An alumina (Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) layer was observed at           
the surface of a Fe-26Al sample carburised at 700 °C. In this case no metal           
dusting was observed for at least 72 h. By X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD)           
cementite (Fe<SUB>3</SUB>C) was detected in the coke. The

(Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) forming iron aluminium alloys are promising           
high-temperature materials for application in the petrochemical industry. Here           
the gaseous environments can have very low oxygen partial pressures. Thus only a           
very thermodynamically stable oxide such as Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> can be           
considered to form a protective scale. First experiments on the metal dusting           
behaviour of Fe<SUB>3</SUB>Al were performed by <I>Grabke</I> et al.           
[#ref<I>3</I>]. The constitution of the Fe-Al-C was investigated by <I>Palm</I>           
and <I>Inden</I> [#ref<I>21</I>]. A ternary carbide           
Fe<SUB>3</SUB>AlC<SUB>x</SUB> (κ-phase) exists in this system which might play           
an important role as suggested by <I>Grabke</I> [#ref<I>3</I>], but his first           
experiments revealed only the presence of cementite after metal dusting           
treatment of Fe<SUB>3</SUB>Al alloys. The mechanisms of metal dusting of iron           
aluminium alloys are still not understood. The resistance of Fe-Al-Cr alloys           
against metal dusting was studied by <I>Klöwer</I> [#ref<I>1</I>]. The           
investigated alloys showed good resistance against corrosive attack in           
CH<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB> gas mixtures at 850, 1000 and 1100 °C. </P></DIV>

cross-section in Fig. 10 shows large pits at the surface. At 700 °C the Fe-26Al           
alloy is resistant against metal dusting for at least 72 h. However, at the same           
temperature the Fe-15Al sample is seriously attacked by a general metal wastage           
after 18.8 h at 700 °C in a 50%CO-49.3%H<SUB>2</SUB>-0.7%H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas           
mixture (Fig. 11a). The metallographic cross-section in Fig. 11a shows           
plate-like carbides close to the decomposition interface. Similar precipitates           
were also found in a Fe-15Al sample carburised for 4 h at 650 °C in a           
15%CO-84.3%H<SUB>2</SUB>-0.7%H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas mixture (Fig. 11b). </P></DIV>

<script>comment();</script><p>Regarding           
Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> formation the following information is relevant for           
an understanding of metal dusting experiments of Fe-Al alloys in carburising and           
oxidising CO-H<SUB>2</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O atmospheres. Although aluminium oxide           
was not detected by XRD analysis due to very small volume fractions its presence           
can be assumed because the oxygen partial pressure in the           
CO-H<SUB>2</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas mixtures is significantly higher than the           
value necessary for alumina formation. For example the equilibrium partial           
pressure of oxygen of the 50%CO-49.3%H<SUB>2</SUB>-0.7%H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas           
mixture is 5.05x10<SUP>-32</SUP> bar at 500 °C and 3.77x10<SUP>-25</SUP> bar at           
700 °C. However, the oxygen partial pressure required for           
Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> formation is only 2.77x10<SUP>-65</SUP> bar at 500           
°C and 8.99x10<SUP>-50</SUP> bar at 700 °C. As it is shown for chromia forming           
alloys [#ref<I>18-20</I>] the formation of an oxide layer generally retards the           
carburisation process. Metal dusting attack occurs preferentially at defects of           
the oxide layer with subsequent pit formation (see Figs. 3a, 4a, and 10). At           
present, conclusions concerning details of the pit formation during metal           
dusting of iron aluminium alloys can not be drawn. Also the influence of size           
and distribution of defect in the oxide layer on the metal dusting kinetics is           
not yet understood. From the TGA results shown in Fig. 9 it can be deduced that           
an increase of the aluminium content leads to a retardation of the onset of           
metal dusting. </P></DIV>          
<DIV 
align=left>
<script>comment();</script><p>The 
metal dusting attack is differently characterised as pitting (Figs. 2b, 3a, 4a, 
and 10) or general metal wastage (see Figs. 2a, 11a and 11b). Concerning this 
simple distinction it should be mentioned that local attack with many fast 
growing pits and general metal wastage might be the same. </P></DIV>
<DIV 
align=left>
<script>comment();</script><p>Some           
results of the present work confirm the assumption that the alumina formation           
depends on temperature, gas composition and aluminium content. At 500, 600 and           
650 °C no oxides were detected in this work. However, the light optical           
microscopic observation of a thin oxide layer (Fig. 2d) on the Fe-26Al sample           
carburised at 700 °C indicates that an increase of the temperature enhances the           
formation of aluminium oxide. For this sample no metal dusting was detected (see           
also the TGA curves in Figs. 1 and 9c). Thus it can be concluded that the           
presence of the fairly dense oxide layer formed at a relatively high temperature           
of 700 °C leads to a significant protection against metal dusting. However,           
decreasing the aluminium content to 15 at. % leads to a serious attack (Fig.           
9c). </P></DIV>
<DIV 
align=left>
<script>comment();</script><p>At           
temperatures below 700°C no significant protection against metal dusting of           
Fe-Al alloys is observed. Thus it can be concluded that at relatively low           
temperatures there is no distinctive formation of protecting           
Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> layers. This result confirms the reports that with           
increasing temperature the formation of a dense aluminium oxide layer is           
favoured [#ref<I>23</I>]. The formation of <font face="Times New Roman">α</font>-Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> is           
optimal for materials protection because of its very dense crystal structure.           
However, α-Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> formation occurs at temperatures around           
1000 °C or higher [#ref<I>24</I>]. Therefore, a pre-treatment for oxide layer           
formation is required in order to protect iron aluminium alloys from metal           
dusting. The aspect of protective scales will be treated in future. </P></DIV>

<script>comment();</script><p>At           
those locations where carburisation can take place the formation of carbon           
profiles with decreasing carbon content from the surface to the matrix can be           
assumed. Supersaturation of the matrix with carbon will lead to carbide           
formation. Thermodynamic calculations showed that for a binary Fe-15Al alloy the           
formation of the <font face="Times New Roman">κ</font>-phase Fe<SUB>3</SUB>AlC<SUB>x</SUB> and for increased carbon           
contents additional cementite Fe<SUB>3</SUB>C precipitation can be expected           
during carburisation at 650 °C [#ref<I>4</I>]. In this work, κ-phase with Perovskite structure was detected by XRD on Fe-26Al samples carburised at 500           
and 600 °C (Fig. 6). Plate- or needle-like Fe<SUB>3</SUB>AlC<SUB>x</SUB>           
precipitates are directly observed in the matrix close to the surface of a           
carburised Fe-15Al alloy (see Fig. 11). Cross-section analysis by light optical           
and scanning electron microscopy does not reveal the presence of cementite in           
the matrix, but with XRD analysis of the coke removed from this sample cementite           
was detected (Fig. 7). The experimental observation of cementite present in the           
coke leads to the assumption that there are similarities between metal dusting           
of iron and of iron aluminium. The mechanism of metal dusting of iron aluminium           
alloys will be studied in more detail in the future. </P></DIV>

reported by Chun et al. [#ref<I>25</I>]. In their report the rate of metal           
dusting has its maximum at 575°C. This finding supports the assumption of

Fe-Al alloys are oxide formation and carburisation at defects of the oxide at           
the surface. The effect of pre-oxidation was not investigated. </P></DIV>

carbides in the decomposition process still remains unclear. The coke on the
