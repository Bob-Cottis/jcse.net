<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>It is generally accepted that laser surface melting (LSM) can be used for 
improving the localised corrosion resistance of various metallic alloys as a 
result of homogenisation and refinement of microstructures, and phase 
transformations. However, there are exceptions. For example, no improvement of 
pitting corrosion resistance of a wide range of aluminium alloys by LSM has been 
reported. This paper investigates the corrosion performance of laser-melted Al 
2014 alloy in the T6 and T451 conditions to determine the key factors 
influencing pitting corrosion performance. LSM was carried out using a 3 kW CW 
Nd:YAG laser with a line beam profile. Examination of laser-melted surfaces in 
terms of microstructure, elemental distribution and phase analysis was performed 
using SEM/EDX, EPMA and XRD. Pitting corrosion resistance was evaluated using 
potentiodynamic anodic polarisation in de-aerated 1 M NaCl solution. Laser 
treatment enhanced the pitting potential by up to 170 and 110 mV for the T6 and 
T451 conditions respectively. The major factor contributing to the improvement 
appeared to be alloying elements, mainly of copper, in the aluminium matrix with 
refinement of the microstructure, with finer intermetallic particles, appear to 
playing a lesser role. </P>

<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>Laser surface melting (LSM) offers significant potential for improving 
surface properties, such as corrosion and wear resistance. It is generally 
accepted that the improvement in corrosion performance is due to 
refinement/homogenisation of microstructure and dissolution/redistribution of 
precipitates or inclusions, which result from rapid solidification. LSM has been 
used to improve pitting corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steels, 
with shifts of the pitting potential by up to 400 mV resulting from elimination 
or reduction of MnS inclusions that are believed to be common sites for 
initiation of pitting [1]. However, LSM may offer little benefit to the 
corrosion resistance of some materials, for instance, many aluminium alloys. 
Thus, although LSM has been reported to raise the pitting potential of Al 
2014-T6 alloy [2], other work has shown no improvement in pitting corrosion 
resistance of&nbsp; 2024-T351 alloy in 3 wt% NaCl solution [3], Al-Si alloy in 
10 wt% HCl and 5 wt% NaCl solutions [4], Al 3003 alloy in 0.1 M NaCl solution 
[5] and Al 7075 alloy in 3 wt% NaCl solution [6]. To date, no detailed 
explanation has been given for these contrasting behaviours, in particular 
concerning the relationship between microstructure and electrochemical response. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the corrosion 
performances of laser-melted Al 2014 alloy in the T6 (artificial ageing) and 
T451 (natural aging) conditions to determine the key factors influencing pitting 
corrosion performance.</P>
<H3>2.&nbsp;Experimental procedure</H3>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>AISI 2014 alloy, nominal composition (wt%) 3.9 � 5 Cu, 0.2 - 0.8 Mg, 0.4 - 
1.2 Mn, 0.5 - 1.2 Si, 0.7 Fe (max), 0.1 Cr (max), and balance Al of 8 mm 
thickness, in the T6 and T451 tempers, was used for this study. A 3 kW CW Nd:YAG 
laser, with a line beam source produced by a parabolic line segmented optic, was 
utilized with Table 1 providing the laser operating parameters employed. Figure 
1 shows the power density distribution of the laser beam along the y and x axes 
corresponding to the width of the laser beam and the direction of beam traverse 
respectively. Prior to laser treatment, the surface of each specimen was 
sandblasted by 99.9% Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> ,with grit diameter 62-74 &#956;m, 
to enhance the surface absorption. Argon gas was passed over the melt pool at 20 
l/min to prevent surface oxidation. </P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>After laser treatment, the characterisation of microstructure, chemical 
composition and phase formation was carried out by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) with associated elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) 
spectroscopy, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
The electrochemical behaviours of the as-received and the laser-treated 
specimens were examined in deaerated 1 M NaCl solution at 30 �C. Specimens were 
mounted in epoxy resin, ground and then polished to a 1 mm diamond finish. The 
solutions were deaerated by initial purging with nitrogen for 45 min and with 
continued purging throughout the test. The specimens were immersed in the 
solution for 50 min to stabilize the open circuit potential. Anodic polarisation 
curves were then determined at a potential scan rate of 0.167 mV/s using a 
Schlumberger SI 1280 computer-controlled potentiostat and a conventional 
three-electrode cell employing a platinized titanium counter electrode and a 
saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE).</P>

<h4>3.1 Microstructure</h4>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>
<p>As-received Al 2014 alloy in both the T6 and T451 conditions contained 
similar intermetallic particles distributed randomly in the aluminium matrix 
(Figure 2); SEM/EDX distinguished three types of precipitates: Type 1 � roughly 
spherical Al-Cu&nbsp; particles, of approximate size 5-15 mm, Type 2 - large, 
10-20 mm, but irregular shaped Al-Cu-Mn-Fe-Si particles, and Type 3 � Mg-Si 
particles, of size 2 mm, adjacent to the Al-Cu particles. Types 1 and 3 are 
assigned to Al<SUB>2</SUB>Cu and MgSi<SUB>2</SUB> phases, which were identified 
by XRD (Figure 3). These analyses agree with findings in the literature [7,8]. 
The alloy also revealed a preferred orientation of the matrix grows in the [111] 
direction. </p>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>After the laser treatment, the surfaces appeared very smooth. For a given 
power and beam size, the melt pool geometry changed from hemispherical to 
flat-bottomed with increase of traverse speed as thermal diffusion became 
limited. The flat-bottomed shape is desirable for most laser surface treatments. 
Similar solidification microstructures were found for both tempers of the alloy, 
consisting of columnar cells that had grown epitaxially from the unmelted 
substrate (Figure 4). A thin layer of planar front zone, of thickness 3-5 mm was 
located at the fusion boundary with the substrate. Beyond this interface, the 
microstructure changed rapidly from cellular to cellular dendritic/dendritic. 
Such microstructures were in accord with the high initial ratio of thermal 
gradient G and solidification rate R when solidification began, and its fall-off 
as solidification proceeded towards the free surface. The cellular layer was 
very narrow, approximately 20 mm, due to the rapid variation of the G/R ratio. 
</P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>The solidification microstructure within the melted zone consisted of a 
continuous network of second phase precipitates, appearing as light areas at 
dendrite boundaries, enveloping aluminium matrix phase, of dark appearance. 
Microsegregation of alloying elements, mainly of copper, but also of magnesium 
and manganese and silicon, which occurred when the solute was rejected at the 
liquid/solid interface, and a boundary layer enriched in alloying elements 
developed in the liquid immediately ahead of the solidification front, resulting 
in the formation of precipitates in the interdendritic spaces. The solute 
segregation was highly dependent on the thermal process in terms of thermal 
gradient, solidification rate and cooling rate that were determined by the laser 
operating conditions. Heat-transfer calculations [9] show that the cooling rate 
increases rapidly from the fusion boundary towards the surface. Thus, the 
dendritic arm spacing increased from 2 &#956;m at the surface to 4 &#956;m at the boundary 
(Figure 5). Similarly, under constant laser power and beam size, increasing 
traverse speed, and hence increasing cooling rate, reduced the spacing. Further, 
the combination of lower power density and longer interaction time for the 10 mm 
laser beam than those of the 6 mm beam produced a much slower cooling and hence 
a greater dendritic arm spacing.</P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>Generally, microsegregation increased with decreasing cooling rate, similar 
to that of dendritic arm spacing. Thus, the copper concentration within the 
planar front zone of specimen A7 by EPMA was 1.5 wt%, and increasing to 2.5 wt% 
in dendritic cores, i.e. in the a-Al matrix, close to the faster cooling surface 
area. These values compare with an estimated 0.04 wt% Cu, the equilibrium matrix 
concentration, for the as-received alloy. The copper concentration within 
dendritic cores was also found to increase with increasing of traverse speed, 
i.e with increasing cooling rate, from 1.7 wt% for specimen A5 to 2.5 wt% for 
specimen A7. Further, EPMA mapping of specimen B1 disclosed that enrichment of 
copper, magnesium, manganese and silicon in dendritic boundaries, Figures 6 and 
7, which became more pronounced towards the fusion boundary. Specimens treated 
with the 6 mm beam presented less copper segregation along the dendritic 
boundaries than those treated with the 10 mm beam due to the further cooling 
rate with the narrow beam. </P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>The average value of the magnesium concentration in laser-treated specimens 
decreased to 0.3 wt%, compared with 0.8 wt% of the as-received alloy, due to the 
selective vaporisation of magnesium during laser melting, which was been 
reported previously for LSM of Al 2024 alloy [3]. EPMA mapping indicated 
magnesium and silicon in precipitates with a low population density. XRD 
disclosed &#952;-Al<SUB>2</SUB>Cu and a-Al, with a preferred orientation of the 
lattice in the [200] direction that increased with decreasing cooling rate 
(Figures 8 a-b). Due to the resolution limitations of EDX and EPMA, it was not 
possible to measure the precise compositions of the various microstructural 
regions, for specimens treated with the 6 mm beam, with dendritic arm spacing of 
1-2 mm. </P>

<h4>3.2&nbsp; Pitting corrosion behaviour</h4>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>The pitting potentials of the as-received Al 2014 alloy for the T6 and T451 
tempers were -730 mV and �630 mV respectively (Table 2). A large number of pits, 
randomly distributed on the surface, were present after testing (Figure 9a). 
Although Al 2014 alloy in both tempers consisted of similar types of 
intermetallic particles, the copper content in the aluminium matrix for T6 is 
lower than that for T451. In the NaCl electrolyte, Al<SUB>2</SUB>Cu, and 
Al-Cu-Mn-Fe-Si particles tend to be cathodic to the matrix [9], and&nbsp; pits 
are likely to initiate and grow in the copper-depleted zone around these 
particles [10]. Mg<SUB>2</SUB>Si particles are anodic to the aluminium matrix, 
and have a tendency to dissolve and leaving cavities [11]. </P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>After laser treatment (Table 2), the pitting potentials decreased with the 
distance from the surface to the bottom of the melt pool. For instance, pitting 
potentials of B2 with grinding off of 20 mm and 100 mm were �515 mV and �560 mV 
respectively. Further, reduced pitting potentials were evident for the 6 mm 
beam. These trends correlate with coarsening of the dendritic structure and 
reducing of the copper concentration within the aluminium matrix with distance 
from the surface. The initial temper conditions did not influence pitting 
potentials of the laser-melted surfaces. However, with the T451 temper, 
improvement was only achieved using the 6 mm beam width, possibly because of 
similarity of concentrations of alloying element in solid solution with the 
initial material and following treatment with the larger beam with slower 
cooling rate.</P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>Pits formed on the laser-melted surfaces were larger but shallower than those 
in the as-received alloy, with a semi-continuous network, consisting of 
copper-rich precipitates, remaining within the pits, indicating their cathodic 
nature (Figure 9b). The size of the cells in the network was similar to the 
dendritic arm spacing found in non-corroded areas. Pitting apparently initiated 
in the cores of the dendrites, leading to dissolution of the matrix along the 
cell orientation and spreading to nearby areas. </P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>Although significant reduction of the size of intermetallic particle after 
the laser melting was obtained for Al 2014-T451 treated by the 10 mm beam width, 
the pitting potential was not affected. Further, no improvement of pitting 
corrosion behaviour in laser-melted Al 2024-T351, Al 3003 and Al 7075 alloys 
occurs with rapidly solidified microstructures. Thus, the increase of pitting 
potentials after LSM cannot be attributed solely to the formation of a refined 
microstructure, with finer intermetallic particle, although such refinement 
might play an important role in metastable pitting process, such as by reduction 
of flaw densities in the passive film. Therefore, it is proposed the 
concentrations of solid solution alloy elements, particularly copper, are key 
factors influencing pitting corrosion. Such increase of copper content in the 
aluminium matrix can reduce the potential difference between the 
Al<SUB>2</SUB>Cu phases and the aluminium matrix, thereby reducing the driving 
force for pitting corrosion. The reduction in population, or the elimination of 
Mg<SUB>2</SUB>Si particles which are anodic to aluminium matrix may further 
improve the behaviour by reducing cavities due to the dissolved particles. 
Dissolution of such particles should increase with increased copper 
concentration in the matrix. </P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>Regarding influences of preferred orientation, the literature [12] indicates 
that the pitting potential of aluminium increases in order of (E<SUB>pit</SUB>) 
<SUB>{001}</SUB> &gt;(E<SUB>pit</SUB>)<SUB>{011}</SUB> &gt;(E<SUB>pit</SUB>) 
<SUB>{111}</SUB>, however, the presence of alloyed copper in solid solution 
reduces the dependence of E<SUB>pit</SUB> on surface orientation. Thus, the 
preferred orientation of a-Al along [200] direction in laser-treated alloy does 
not appear to play a significant role in the improved pitting behaviour.</P>

<P>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LSM increased the pitting potential of Al 
2014 alloy in the T6 and T451 tempers and changed the pitting morphology. The 
initial temper condition did not affect significantly the pitting corrosion

<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditions of more rapid cooling associated 
with increased retention of alloying elements, particularly copper, in solid 
solution and reduced microsegregration led to greatest improvement in pitting 
potentials. Thus, increased pitting potentials were achieved with faster scan 
rates, a smaller beam and with material closer to the surface of the melt 
pool.</P>
<SCRIPT>comment();</SCRIPT>

<P>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extensions of copper solubility in 
aluminium matrix was considered to be the key factor responsible for the 
increase of pitting potential, probably associated with the reduction of 
galvanic coupling between the Al<SUB>2</SUB>Cu particles and the aluminium 
matrix.</P>
