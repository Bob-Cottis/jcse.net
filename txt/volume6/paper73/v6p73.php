<h3>Abstract</h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>The effect of Ni and NiO coatings on Fe-22Cr during oxidation at 1173K
in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O was examined with respect to scale microstructure for
oxidation times between 0 and 504 hours. Upon oxidation of the as pre-treated
Fe-22Cr, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and a spinel developed. Oxidation and
inter-diffusion between the Ni coating and Fe-22Cr occurred simultaneously. The
scale consisted of NiO, a Fe-Ni spinel and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the NiO coated alloy, a thin spinel layer developed between the NiO
coating and the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scale. The microstructures of the
scales are discussed with respect to calculated isotherms in the Fe-Cr-O,
Cr-Ni-O and Ni-Fe-O phase diagrams and inter-diffusion profiles between Ni and
Fe-22Cr. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>In Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stacks the interconnect separates the
fuel on the anode side from the oxidant at the cathode side and it serves to
transport the electrical current between the individual cells and to the
external circuit. High-temperature oxidation resistant Fe-Cr alloys are
candidates for interconnect materials, due to the combination of a slow oxide
layer growth rate and a reasonable (but still low) conductivity of the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
scale [<SCRIPT>crossref(1);</SCRIPT>]. However, the contribution of the growing chromia scale to the
total resistance of the SOFC stack gets significant during the operation time
of the stack. Therefore, the growth rate of the scale has to be reduced by
coating and, simultaneously the conductivity of the scale has to be
enhanced.� </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The conductivity of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be enhanced by
doping it with a divalent cation, e.g. Ni<sup>2+</sup>, because this increases
the hole-concentration of the intrinsic conductor, cf. equation 1. The effect
is most pronounced in oxidizing atmospheres [<SCRIPT>crossref(2);</SCRIPT>].</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Huang et al. [<SCRIPT>crossref(3);</SCRIPT>] found that hot-dipping Ebrite steel (~ Fe-26.3 wt%
Cr) in Ni<sup>2+</sup>- and Ni<sup>+2</sup>/Y<sup>3+</sup> nitrate solutions
before oxidation reduces the contact resistance of pre-oxidized samples against
platinum as compared to a non-coated or Y<sup>3+</sup> coated steel. They also
observed that the oxidation rate was slightly reduced by the presence of a �Ni<sup>2+</sup>
coating�. However, adherence of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the alloy was
poor and oxide spallation was visible.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Under the working condition of the cathode (typically 1123 K and air
with about 3% H<sub>2</sub>O) Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>disintegrates by evaporationof CrO<sub>3</sub> and CrO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>
[<SCRIPT>crossref(4);</SCRIPT>]. Such evaporation is detrimental for the electrical performance of the SOFC [<SCRIPT>crossref(4);</SCRIPT>] and a suitable coating is sought to reduce/ prevent this
evaporation. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>In the present paper, the oxidation of Fe-22Cr at 1173K is investigated
for as pre-treated, Ni- and NiO coated conditions. The results are discussed in
relation to the Ni-Cr-O, the Cr-Fe-O and the Fe-Ni-O phase diagrams. The
isotherms at 1173K (figure 1) and 1323K were calculated with Thermo-Calc
[<SCRIPT>crossref(5);</SCRIPT>], using the assessments in [<SCRIPT>crossref(6);</SCRIPT>], [<SCRIPT>crossref(7);</SCRIPT>] and [<SCRIPT>crossref(8);</SCRIPT>]. Thermodynamics
predicts that a multiphase scale, represented by the dashed line in the Cr-Fe-O
isotherm forms during oxidation of Fe-22Cr. Thermodynamics also predicts that
the NiO coating reacts with the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scale to form the
spinel NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which has been reported to be a good
electrical conductor (s = 2.70 S cm<sup>-1
</sup>at 1273K, porosity = 38%, doped with 0.66 at% Ce [<SCRIPT>crossref(9);</SCRIPT>]).</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4>Reaction between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>In order to investigate the possible reaction between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
mixtures of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NiO powders were prepared with the
following Ni: Cr cation ratios: 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5 (the crosses in the
Ni-Cr-O isotherm represents these mixtures). They were heat-treated twice at
1173 or 1323K in air (heating rate 100 K/h) for 60 hours followed by quenching
in air. The second heat-treatment was performed in order to ensure that
equilibrium was reached. After each heat-treatment, all mixtures were
characterised with XRD using Si as a reference.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>High-temperature XRD was preformed on the mixture with the cation ratio
Ni:Cr 1:2. </p>

<h4>Pre-treatment of Fe-22Cr</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>A 0.2 mm thick Fe-22Cr foil, containing 21.63 wt% Cr, 0.31 wt% Si, 0.27
wt% Mn, 0.19 wt% Ni and 0.011wt% Ce as main alloying elements was used in the
present work. The Fe-22Cr foil was etched in an aqueous solution (75 ml H<sub>2</sub>O)
of conc. HF (5 ml) and conc. HNO<sub>3</sub> (15 ml) in an ultrasonic bath in
order to remove the native oxide layer.</p>

<h4>Deposition of the Ni-coating</h4>

<p>The Ni-coating was electrodeposited by a commercial process yielding a
thickness of approximately 5�m.</p>

<h4>Deposition of the NiO-coating </h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>NiO coatings were deposited by spray-painting and plasma spraying. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>In the case of spray-painting, an ethanol-based slurry of NiO particles
(particle size: 0.1-20 �m, average 5.35 �m) was sprayed onto pre-treated
Fe-22Cr samples at room temperature, using air as the carrier gas. The
thickness of the as-sprayed layer was about 15 �m. The samples were annealed
for 2 hours in air at 1123, 1223, 1323 and 1423K; the heating- and cooling rates
were 100K/h. Samples annealed at 1323K were used in the oxidation measurements.
</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Prior to plasma spraying the etched Fe-22Cr samples were sandblasted
with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in order to ensure good adherence of the
coating to the substrate. The NiO powder was mixed with 2 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub>
to improve the flow-ability of the powder during spraying. Oxygen was used as
carrier gas. The thickness of the coating was 15-20 �m and it contained some
porosity. </p>

<h4>High temperature oxidation</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>High temperature oxidation experiments were performed on as pre-treated,
NiO-coated and Ni-coated samples at 1173K (�7K) in air containing 1 % H<sub>2</sub>O. The heating
time was ca. 2 hours and the cooling time was ca. 6 hours. The oxidation time
(not including the heating- and cooling time) was varied between 0 and 504
hours.</p>

<h4>Microstructure characterization</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>For phase identification X-ray diffractograms were measured for selected
samples using a STOE diffractometer equipped with Cu-Ka radiation
(XRD). On the spray-painted samples, diffractograms were also recorded after
removing the upper part of the NiO particle layer by grinding. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Samples for cross-sectional investigation were mounted in resin, ground
and polished (last step 1 �m diamond). Microstructure investigations were
performed using a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope (SEM) in
back-scatter electron (BSE) mode. Local chemical analysis was performed using
Noran energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). </p>

<h3>RESULTS</h3>

<h4>Reaction between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Upon reaction between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powders a tetragonal
distorted spinel with the lattice parameters a = 0.584 nm and c = 0.843 nm
developed. It has the cation ratio Ni:Cr = 1:2, i.e. would be consistent with
NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. With respect to this stoichiometry, the Ni-rich
mixtures consisted of NiO and NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, whilst the Cr-rich
mixture consisted of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
High temperature XRD showed, that the tetragonally distorted spinel transformed
instantaneously to a cubic spinel with a = 0.831 nm at ca. 315K.</p>

<h4>The structure of the spray-painted NiO coating</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Cross-sections of NiO coated samples annealed at 1323 and 1423K are
shown in figure 2. At the temperatures investigated, a Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer developed at the metal surface; the thickness of the layer increased with
increasing annealing temperature. The NiO powder sintered during the 2 hours
annealing; the NiO particle-layer became denser the higher the temperature.
Dark regions consisting of silica (determinated by EDS-analyses) appeared in
the substrate below the coating of the samples baked at 1323K (in some areas)
and 1423K. Atomic Force Microscopy on similarly treated samples showed an
increase in height across the dark regions. This strongly indicates that the
dark regions consist entirely of silica, as silica has a higher hardness than
the matrix.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>In the samples annealed at 1223, 1323 and 1423K a spinel phase with a
lattice parameter between 0.83518 (�0.00025) and 0.83558 (�0.00020) nm was identified by XRD. EDS-line scans
across the NiO - Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interface gave no indication of
the presence of a mixed oxide phase in any of the samples. </p>

as pre-treated, the Ni-coated and NiO-coated samples oxidized for one week at

<script>comment();</script><p>On the as pre-treated sample, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and a spinel
phase with a lattice parameter between 0.84425 (�0.00032) and 0.84649 (�0.00025) nm developed during oxidation. EDS-line scans
across the scale identified Cr and possibly Mn (note the slight increase in the
Mn signal at the oxide surface and the decrease in the Cr-signal). The presence
of Mn cations in chromia scales is difficult to investigate with EDS, because
the characteristic energies of Cr-K&beta; and Mn-K&alpha; overlap on dispersive analysis. The interface between
Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and the alloy appears dark, which is likely
associated with the development of silica at this location (note the enhanced
Si content as revealed by EDS).� </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The scale on the Ni-coated sample can be sub-divided in three zones (cf.
figure 4).� The top, light grey layer
consist mainly of NiO with 1-2 wt% Fe. The layer was only found locally on the
samples oxidized for 2 or more weeks due to spallation (cf. figure 5).</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>A darker shade of grey is observed as an intermediate layer between NiO
and the dark grey layer immediately adjacent to the substrate. According to the
EDS line profiles the substrate adjacent layer consists of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and the intermediate layer of Ni-Fe oxide with possibly a small gradient of Cr
close to the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This could be consistent with the
observation of a spinel, a = 0.838 nm, phase in X-ray diffractograms. Close to
the surface a similar shade of grey as for the intermediate layer appears
locally, possibly associated with grain boundaries in the NiO layer. This shade
of grey is also observed close to pores in the lower part of the NiO layer. On
both locations enhanced Fe contents are observed in the EDS line profiles (and
EDS-single spot analyses), strongly suggesting the presence of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<h4>The NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powders</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Thermodynamic calculations predict the development of the NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
spinel upon reaction of NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at 1173 K (cf.
figure 1) and 1323 K in air (at 1323 K the spinel forms at p(O<sub>2</sub>) =
10<sup>-12 </sup>bar). NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> did indeed form by
reaction between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder at both
temperatures.� The self-diffusion
coefficients of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Cr<sup>3+</sup> [<SCRIPT>crossref(10);</SCRIPT>] in NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
are of the same order of magnitude, whereas the oxygen self-diffusion
coefficient is approximately one order of magnitude smaller [<SCRIPT>crossref(11);</SCRIPT>]. This
indicates that NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> forms by counter-diffusion of the
relatively small cations over the interstices of the relatively rigid (fully
occupied) O<sup>2-</sup> lattice.</p>

<h4>Oxidation of as pre-treated samples</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>During oxidation of the as pre-treated samples, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and a spinel phase formed, as detected by XRD. The presence of FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
could not be confirmed by EDS. According to the Cr- Fe-O phase diagram at
1173K, figure 1, only corundum is thermodynamically stable for an oxygen
partial pressure corresponing to that of air. Following the vertical dashed
line in the Cr- Fe-O in the direction of decreasing p(O<sub>2</sub>), a
multi-layered scale and several zones of internal oxidation are expected
between the corundum layer and the substrate. Neither of these appeared in the
cross-section (Figure
3). Selective oxidation of Cr is favoured at chromium
contents above 14 wt %; selective oxidation of Cr stabilizes the chromia-based
scale at the expense of the faster growing spinel [<SCRIPT>crossref(12);</SCRIPT>].</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>During oxidation of FeCr alloys a layer containing a large proportion of
iron oxides forms in the beginning of the oxidation process, because the iron
oxides grow faster than Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>[<SCRIPT>crossref(13);</SCRIPT>].� The identified spinel
might be a Fe-Cr spinel formed by reaction between initially form iron oxides
and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. However, thermodynamics predicts that
initially grown iron oxides are incorporated in Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
because Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> form a
continuous series of solid solutions cf. figure 1.� </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The alloy contains a small amount of Mn. The formation of MnCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
spinel on the top of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has been observed during the
oxidation of high-alloy steel with a low Mn content (0.56-1.58 wt %) [<SCRIPT>crossref(14);</SCRIPT>]
(0.31 wt %) [<SCRIPT>crossref(15);</SCRIPT>] in air and has been explained by very fast diffusion of Mn
cations through Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> [<SCRIPT>crossref(16);</SCRIPT>]. The lattice parameter of
the identified spinel a = 0.84425 (�0.00032) and 0.84649 (�0.00025) nm nm is close to that of MnCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
(0.8413 nm). </p>

<h4>Oxidation of the Ni-coated samples</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Upon the oxidation of the Ni-coated samples, two competing processes
occur: Inter-diffusion between the Ni-coating and the Fe-22Cr alloy and
oxidation of the Ni-coating.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Inter-diffusion between Fe-22Cr (bcc, 100 �m) and Ni (fcc, 5 �m) was
investigated with DICTRA [<SCRIPT>crossref(17);</SCRIPT>] by calculation of the concentration profiles
of Fe, Cr and Ni after diffusion at 1173K for 1 hour and 10 hours in an inert
atmosphere (cf. figure 8). The calculation shows that the thickness of the fcc
phase increases with annealing time. The Cr-concentration drops sharply across
the bcc � fcc interface, whilst the Ni and Fe concentration change more
gradually. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The porosities at and close to the NiO � spinel interface might have
appeared as a consequence of the inter-diffusion between the Ni-coating and the
Fe-22Cr substrate. In the case, that the inward Ni-flux differs from the sum of
the out-ward Fe and Cr fluxes, there will be a net flux of vacancies which
might coalesce as Kirkendall porosities. This may have occurred close to the
Ni/Fe-22Cr interface (alternatively or additionally, these voids could be the
result of outward diffusion of Ni cations on oxidation, see below).</p>

<script>comment();</script><p><img

<script>comment();</script><p><a name="_Ref40713944">Figure </a>8: Left: Concentration
profiles across the Fe-22Cr (bcc, 100�m) � Ni (fcc, 5�m) interface after 1 hour

indicate the position of the interface between bcc and fcc. Only Fe, Cr and Ni
are included in the calculation. Right: The Fe-Ni-Cr phase diagram at 1173K as
calculated using Thermo-Calc [<SCRIPT>crossref(5);</SCRIPT>]</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The experiments show that Ni has diffused throughout the Fe-22Cr foil
for oxidation times longer than 72 hours, resulting in a Ni bulk content of
about 2 wt %. According to the Fe-Cr-Ni phase diagram at 1173K, figure 8, the
maximum solubility of Ni in Fe-21.63 wt % Cr is 2.13 wt %, indicating that the
ferritic substrate has been saturated with Ni. At this stage, the Ni content in
the alloy at a depth of 10 �m is so high (ca. 20 wt %) that the outer part of
the alloy is austenitic. The fcc phase is expected to grow with oxidation time
as Cr is consumed during the growth of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and less Fe
and Ni are needed to stabilize the fcc phase. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The concentration profiles in figure 8, left, also show that the coating
is richer in Fe than in Cr. This result of the calculations would be consistent
with the observation (from EDS-line scans) that the spinel formed in-between
the NiO and the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer and the spinel formed close
to the surface is richer in Fe (and Ni) than in Cr. </p>

<p>At temperatures below 1373K, NiO grows predominantly by outward Ni
diffusion via short circuit paths, particularly grain boundaries [<SCRIPT>crossref(18);</SCRIPT>]. For
Ni with a purity less than 99.99%, voids are formed at the oxide-metal
interface by accumulation of Ni vacancies. Compressive stresses in combination
with the voids lead to local detachment of the scale and shear stresses in the
detached parts initiate cracks through the NiO layer [<SCRIPT>crossref(19);</SCRIPT>]. O<sub>2</sub>
penetrates the cracks and reacts with Ni below the detached oxide and forms a
fine-grained NiO. The cracks may heal as the outward Ni diffusion is not
interrupted causing an internal volume increase and thereby growth stresses,
which initiate new cracks. The resulting NiO scale has a duplex structure with
an outer columnar and an inner equiaxed grained scale [<SCRIPT>crossref(19);</SCRIPT>][<SCRIPT>crossref(20);</SCRIPT>]. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>From figure 4 it is evident that the NiO formed upon oxidation of the
Ni-coated Fe-22Cr contains voids at and close to the NiO - spinel interface
(alternatively or additionally, these voids could be associated with the diffusion
of Ni into the substrate, see above). </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Furthermore the NiO grains appear columnar. Cracks may have formed
during the NiO growth. As a consequence of inter-diffusion between the
Ni-coating and the substrate, the O<sub>2</sub> penetration may have resulted
in the formation of the Fe-Ni rich spinel, instead of an inner equiaxed grained
NiO layer. This is supported by thermodynamic calculations, which predict the
formation of both the spinel and NiO for 0.23 &lt; n(Ni)/((n(Ni)+n(Fe)) &lt; 0.85, cf. the Ni-Fe-O isotherm in figure 1.
Furthermore, the appearance the Fe-Ni spinel along grain boundaries in NiO (cf.
figure 4) indicates that also Fe diffuses along short circuits.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> forms in-between the alloy and the spinel
because it is thermodynamically the most stable oxide in the Fe-Cr-Ni-O system
(cf. figure 1). The Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer appears thicker and more
porous in areas, where the NiO has spalled off. Spallation may have occurred
during oxidation due to growth stresses or during cooling due to thermal
stresses. In both cases, the cracks have most likely propagated along the NiO -
spinel interface due to the presence of voids at this location. This is
supported by the occurrence of thin light oxide layer on top of the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer, where NiO is missing. The enhanced growth of chromia indicates that
spallation has occurred during oxidation. After spallation, the newly created
surface is exposed to the ambient atmosphere and thereby a higher chemical
potential of oxygen. The increase in the chemical potential leads to a steeper
gradient in the oxygen potential and thus faster growth. </p>

<h4>The NiO-coated samples</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>The formation of the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer below the NiO
spray-painted/ plasma sprayed coating during annealing/ oxidation is in
accordance with the Ni-Cr-O phase diagram (figure 1), which shows that Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
is thermodynamically more stable than NiO and NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The formation of NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> by cation inter-diffusion
between the formed Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the NiO coating (both
spray-painted and plasma-sprayed) was expected during annealing/ oxidation. Although
a spinel did form during annealing of the spray-painted samples, it was not
NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as it would transforms instantaneously to a
tetragonal phase during cooling. Substituting a small amount of the Cr or Ni
with Fe might result in a spinel, which transforms to a distorted spinel at a
temperature below room temperature. Fe may be present at this location as a
large proportion of iron oxide forms in the initial stage of oxidation of FeCr
alloys due to faster growth rate of iron oxides than of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
[<SCRIPT>crossref(13);</SCRIPT>]. Alternatively, the spinel might be a Ni-Fe spinel formed by reaction
between the initially formed iron oxides and the NiO coating. The lattice
parameter, a = 0.83518 (�0.00025) and
0.83558 (�0.00020) nm
of the identified spinel is close to that of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (a =
0.8339 nm). </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>A similar spinel might have formed in-between the NiO plasma coating and
the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer as the EDS-line scans indicates the
presence of Fe in this interface.</p>

<h4>The role of Si</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Silica develops below Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> because it is
thermodynamically more stable than Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (SiO<sub>2</sub>
is placed below Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a Ellingham/ Richardson diagram)
[<SCRIPT>crossref(13);</SCRIPT>]. Silica can be present as a more or less continuous thin layer
in-between the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer and the substrate (after
oxidation of the as pre-treated Fe-22Cr, cf. figure 3), and as particles in the alloy (after oxidation
of the Ni-coated sample and after annealing of the NiO spray-painted sample
at 1423K, cf.
figure 2). A combination of both appearances, i.e. silica films and silica
particles, was observed in different areas of the NiO spray-painted sample
after annealing at 1323K. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The
different appearances of silica could be explained as follows. The appearance
of silica as a thin layer at the scale/substrate interface reflects the higher
thermodynamic stability of this oxide as compared to chromia. The nucleation of
silica in the substrate is expected to occur at the location where vacancies,
necessary to maintain the outward diffusive fluxes of Fe and Cr, are
annihilated. For the case that Kirkendall porosity develops in the substrate,
silicon is anticipated to segregate at the internal surfaces thus created and
is later oxidised to silica. This occurs particularly when a high outward flux
of Cr (and Fe) is maintained, i.e. at a relatively high temperature where CrO<sub>3</sub>
and /or CrO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> evaporate.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> forms closest to the alloy upon oxidation of
coated and as pre-treated samples, as this is the thermodynamically most stable
oxide in the Cr-Fe-Ni-O system. Silica forms as an interfacial film between the
alloy and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or as particles in the alloy. The silica
is situated below Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> because it is thermodynamically
more stabile than Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>A spinel is formed upon oxidation of the as pre-treated Fe-22Cr. The
spinel was proposed to be MnCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> due to the fast
diffusion of Mn cations through Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Oxidation and inter-diffusion between the Ni-coating and Fe-22Cr
occurred competitively. NiO, Fe-Ni-spinel and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
develop during oxidation. The outer part of the alloy becomes austenitic due to
the inter-diffusion, after ca. 72 hours of exposure the Fe-22Cr is saturated in
Ni. Continued depletion of Cr due to oxidation most likely results in growth of
the austenitic region.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>A thin spinel layer developed between the NiO coating and the Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
scale. It was proposed to be a Fe-Ni spinel (or a Fe-Ni-Cr spinel) formed by
inter-diffusion between initially formed iron oxide and the NiO coating (and
the chromia scale). </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>At 1173K and 1323K, NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> forms by
inter-diffusion between NiO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder. NiCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
is tetragonal a room temperature but transform instantaneously to a cubic
spinel at about 315K.</p>
