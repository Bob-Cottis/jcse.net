<h3>Abstract</h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>The effect of partial oxygen pressure and a
native oxide on the structure, morphology and chemical constitution of the
initial oxide layer grown on a <i>M</i>CrAlY bond
coat was investigated. To this end, a state-of-the-art Ni-19Co-18Cr-21Al-0.2Y
(at.%) bond coat, as prepared by electron beam physical vapour deposition, was
oxidised in a UHV reaction chamber, with or without its native oxide, at 1373 K
and a partial oxygen pressure of 0.1 <st1:State><st1:place>Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> The structure,
morphology and chemical constitution of the initially grown oxide layer, as
well as the oxidation-induced changes within the coating, were characterised
using a broad range of analytical techniques. Special attention was paid to
differences in the distribution of Y and the presence of any non-protective
oxide phases within the initially grown oxide layer. The results were compared
with a corresponding oxidation treatment at atmospheric conditions in a
conventional tube furnace. It is shown that the exclusive formation of a
continuous, closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer with a strong
Y-enrichment at its outer surface is promoted at low partial oxygen pressure
and in the absence of a native oxide. </p>

<h3><a name="_Ref36272804">Introduction</a></h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>In modern high-temperature (&gt; 1273 K)
coating systems, <i>M</i>CrAlY (<i>M</i> = Ni, Co)
alloys are used as a bond coat between a ceramic thermal barrier topcoat (TBC)
and the Ni-base superalloy component, such as a blade
or vane in a gas turbine engine [1,2]. The superalloy is designed to provide the mechanical strength
of the load-bearing components at high operating temperatures. The TBC, in
conjunction with component cooling, serves to reduce the component-surface
temperature up to about 150 K [3], thereby allowing a higher operating
temperature, which results in an enhanced efficiency of energy conversion. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The susceptibility to cracking and spalling of the coating system in service mainly relies on
the capability of the <i>M</i>CrAlY bond coat to
produce and maintain a protective (i.e. stable, adherent, slow-growing)
&#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer, since the TBC is highly
oxygen-transparent. In practice, the <i>M</i>CrAlY
bond coat is already oxidised upon deposition of the TBC in the fabrication
process. Although the structure, morphology and chemical composition of the
resulting, initial oxide layer are crucial for the subsequent formation and
continued growth of a protective and adherent &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer on the bond coat during service, these aspects are nearly always poorly
defined and controlled.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Therefore, the effect of different, <i>controlled</i>
oxidation or annealing treatments of a <i>M</i>CrAlY
coating on the structure, morphology and chemical composition of the resulting,
initially grown oxide layer, was investigated. To this end, a state-of-the-art
dual-phase Ni-19Co-18Cr-21Al-0.2Y (at.%) coating, as prepared by Electron-Beam
Physical Vapour Deposition (EB-PVD), was annealed or oxidised in a UHV reaction
chamber at a temperature of 1373 K in pure argon or oxygen gas at a pressure of
0.1 Pa, respectively. To study the effect of the presence of a native oxide
film on the coating surface, the treatments were repeated for the
sputtered-clean coating surface. The results for the controlled oxidations
executed in the UHV reaction chamber at a low partial oxygen pressure (<i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>)
were compared with a corresponding oxidation treatment at atmospheric
conditions in a conventional tube furnace. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The microstructure, oxide phase
constitution and chemical composition of the grown oxide layers were
investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron
Spectroscopy (AES), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Secondary Ion Mass
Spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD).
The oxide-layer thickness, morphology and architecture were analysed with Light
Optical Microscopy (LOM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in combination
with X-ray microanalysis. Special attention was paid to differences in the
distribution of Y and the presence of any non-protective oxide phases within
the initially grown oxide layer.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<h4><a name="_Ref35929764">Material</a></h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>A 2 mm thick dual-phase NiCoCrAlY
coating was produced by EB-PVD deposition of an as-cast Ni-20Co-20Cr-22Al-0.2Y
(at.%) alloy. After the deposition process, the
coating was densified by shot-peening
and subsequently stress-relieved by annealing for 2 h at 1353 K in a vacuum
oven (i.e. system pressure ~ 0.1 Pa). The resulting coating has a very low
porosity and possesses a fine-grained, columnar structure, consisting of a
brittle Al-rich/Cr-poor &#946;-phase (bcc) and a more ductile Al-poor/Cr-rich &#947;-phase (fcc). The typical width and length
of the columnar grains is about 1 &#956;m and 50 &#956;m,
respectively.� The nominal composition of
the coating, as determined by EPMA (see Sec. 2.4), was Ni-19Co-18Cr-21Al-0.2Y (at.%).� The corresponding compositions of the &#947;- and &#946;-phase were
Ni-20Co-26Cr-11Al (at.%) and Ni-20Co-8Cr-33Al (at.%),
respectively. The concentration of Y within the &#947; and &#946;-phase
was below the detection limit of the EPMA (i.e. &lt; 85 ppm).
The Y was homogeneously distributed as YNi-rich intermetallic precipitates at the &#947;/&#946;-phase boundaries
within the coating.</p>

<h4>Sample Preparation</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>Disc-shaped specimens (diameter 10 mm and
thickness 1 mm) were cut using spark-erosion. Prior to oxidation, the specimen
surface was prepared by grinding, lapping and polishing, successively.
Polishing was performed with a paste of 3 �m, then 1 �m and finally 0.25 �m
diamond grains. Thereafter, the surface was fine-polished, using a chemical
resistant cloth with a suspension of 0.04 �m silica in distilled water. After
each preparation step the specimens were thoroughly cleaned ultrasonically with
isopropanol and dried by blowing with pure compressed
nitrogen gas.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the preparation of the oxide/coating
cross-sections, first a copper or gold layer was deposited on the grown oxide
layer by evaporation or sputtering, respectively. Then, a nickel layer was
electroplated on top of the copper layer using a <st1:place>Watts</st1:place> bath. Next, the specimen
was cut perpendicular to its surface with a diamond saw. Finally, the
oxide/coating cross-sections were ground and polished as described above. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the preparation of the TEM sample, a 1
mm thick glass plate was glued on the Ni plated side of the specimen (see
above) prior to the cutting. Both sides of the cross section were mechanically
ground and polished until the slide had attained a thickness of about 15 mm. Then, the slide was put onto a Cu slot grid. Finally, both sides
of the cross-section were ion milled (GATAN Precision Ion Polishing System,
type 691) using a 4 keVAr<sup>+</sup>
beam at an angle of 3-5� with
respect to the surface until a hole was formed. Then, at the edge of the hole,
electron transparent areas were present for TEM analysis of the oxide/coating
cross-section.</p>

<h4>Oxidation and Annealing</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>The low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation
experiments, as well as the annealing treatments, were performed at 1373 K in a
UHV reaction chamber (base pressure &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup> Pa) coupled to an
instrument for XPS analysis (base pressure &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup> Pa).� In some cases, the native oxide film (a few
nm thick), consisting of Ni, Al and Cr oxides with adventitious C on top, was
removed prior to oxidation or annealing by sputtering for 1 hour with a focused
4 keVAr<sup>+</sup> beam
scanning the surface area. Next, the specimens were heated within 5 minutes to
1373 K in pure argon gas (99.998 vol.%Ar) at 0.1 <st1:State><st1:place>Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> Then, the coating was either annealed in pure argon gas (99.998 vol.%) at 0.1 Pa or oxidised by exposure to pure oxygen gas
(99.998 vol.%) at 0.1 <st1:State><st1:place>Pa.</st1:place></st1:State></p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The high <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation
experiment was performed at 1373 K (or 1273 K) in a horizontal alumina tube
furnace (Lenton PTF 16/75/610; tube inner diameter 75
mm). A gas mixture of argon (99.998 vol.%Ar) and 20 vol.% oxygen gas (99.998 vol.% O<sub>2</sub>) was passed through the furnace, at a total pressure
of 10<sup>5</sup> Pa (i.e. <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> = 2&times;10<sup>4</sup> Pa), with a controlled flow rate of 750 ml/min.
Before mixing, both gasses were passed through a moisture filter and a charcoal
filter. The specimens were placed in an annealed alumina crucible and
transported to the hot zone of the furnace, which is at the oxidising
temperature of 1373 K. </p>

<h4><a name="_Ref35929260">Analysis and Data Evaluation</a></h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>The coating composition (see Sec. 2.1) was determined with EPMA using a JEOL JXA 8900R
WD/ED combined microanalyzer, equipped with five
wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS) (see [4] for details).</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The chemical constitution at the oxidised
or annealed coating surface was determined with XPS. Spectra were recorded with
a PHI 5400 ESCA instrument, equipped with a spherical capacitor analyser, set
at constant analyser pass energy of 71.55 eV, and
with a step size of 0.125 eV, using unmonochromatised Al or Mg X-ray radiation. The emitted
electrons were detected at an angle of 45� with respect to the specimen surface.
</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>XRD was employed to determine the
crystalline phases present in the grown oxide layers. The diffraction
experiments were performed with a Bruker AXS D5005 &#952;-&#952;diffractometer
using monochromatic Cu K<sub>&#945;</sub> radiation and applying sample rotation. The samples were analysed
in the 2&#952;
range 20-80� with a step size of 0.050�. For phase identification the JCPDS
database was used (<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>JCPDS-International</st1:PlaceName><st1:PlaceType>Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for Diffraction Data, <st1:place>
<st1:City>Swarthemore</st1:City>, <st1:State>PA</st1:State></st1:place>).</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>In some cases, the element distribution as
a function of depth below the oxide surface was determined by SIMS or AES depth
profiling. For the AES analysis, the Ni LMM, Cr LMM, Co LMM, Al KLL, Y MNN, O
KLL and C KLL peaks were recorded with a PHI 4300 scanning Auger electron
microscope using a primary electron beam of 5 keV and
1 �A, and employing a sputter interval of 1 minute (4 keVAr<sup>+</sup> beam; 3x3 mm<sup>2</sup> raster; with Zalar rotation). To resolve the concentration-depth
profiles of the elements in the oxide layer and the coating, first the
intensities of the corresponding oxidic and metallic
components in the measured spectra were resolved as a function of depth below
the surface by Factor Analysis (FA) of the background corrected, normalised
spectra [5]. Next, the corresponding concentration-depth profiles were obtained
by multiplying the resolved metallic and oxidic
intensities of each element with their sensitivity factor and normalising to
100 at.%.� </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the SIMS sputter-depth profiling, a 2 keVAr<sup>+</sup> beam in spot
mode was focused on the oxidised surface and the emitted Al, Ni, Co, Cr and Y
secondary ions were analysed using a quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Balzers QMA 430) equipped with a
three-lens ion optics systems and a secondary electron multiplier (Balzers SEV 217). To reduce charging of the oxide layer
during the SIMS analysis, a 20 nm thick gold layer was sputter-deposited on the
oxidised surface, and any oxide layer present at the backside of the sample was
removed by grinding. To visualize the distribution of the concerned elements as
a function of depth below the oxidised surface, each recorded
element intensity was multiplied with an arbitrary sensitivity factor,
and subsequently normalised.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>LOM and SEM analysis of the prepared
oxide/coating cross-sections was applied to determine the morphology and
architecture of the grown oxide layers. SEM analysis was performed with a JEOL
JSM 6500F, equipped with an Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) for
quantitative composition analysis.
The spectra acquisition and processing was performed with a ThermoNoran
Vantage system.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The TEM analysis was performed with a
Philips CM30T electron microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 300
kV. EDS analysis with a spot size in the range of 10 -
100 nm was applied to determine the composition at specific positions within
the oxide layer and the underlying coating.</p>

<h4>Oxidation-Induced Changes within Coating</h4>

respectively.</span> Clearly, a much thicker oxide layer has formed after
oxidation for 1 hour in a conventional furnace at a relatively high <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>

Pa than for the oxidations in a UHV reaction chamber at a low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
of 0.1 <st1:State><st1:place>Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> Consequently, a stronger Al depletion has occurred (within the same
period) for the oxidation at high <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to the
transformation of the &#946;-phase
into the Al-poor &#947;-phase
in the region contiguous to the oxide/coating interface (further denoted as &#947;*-zone; cf. Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>).</span></p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the oxidations at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>,
the &#947;*-zone is absent. Instead, for
the oxidation of the coating with native oxide, the original dual-phase &#947;+&#946; structure
of the coating is still preserved up to the oxide/coating interface (Fig. <a
href="#fig1">1b</a>), whereas for the oxidation of the sputtered-clean coating,
a single-phase </span>&#946;
region (i.e. Al-rich) has formed in the region contiguous to the oxide/coating
interface (further denoted as &#946;*-zone; see Fig. <a href="#fig1">1c</a> and Sec. 3.2).</span></p>

<script>comment();</script><p>It is concluded that, for the
high-temperature oxidation of a <i>M</i>CrAlY
coating, the oxide-layer growth kinetics and its associated Al depletion from
the coating are suppressed at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>. As demonstrated in
Ref. [4] for the high-temperature oxidation of &#947;-NiCrAl, a lower <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
reduces the activity of oxygen at the oxide/alloy interface during the initial,
fast oxidation stage, thereby promoting the coalescence of initially grown &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
crystallites into a continuous closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer. Consequently, the duration of
the initial, very fast oxidation stage and the associated Al depletion from the
coating are suppressed. The presence of a native oxide layer on the coating may
result in an additional, small decrease of the activity of oxygen at the native
oxide/coating interface at the onset of oxidation.</p>

<h4><a name="_Ref36288330">Annealing-Induced Changes within
Coating</a></h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the sputtered-clean coating, no native
oxide resides on the coating surface at the start of the oxidation in the UHV
chamber. Due to the absence of the native oxide, extensive Cr evaporation
occurs upon heating in UHV and subsequent oxidation at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>.
As evidenced by LOM and SEM analysis of the coating after sputter-cleaning and
subsequent annealing in the UHV chamber for 1 h at 1373 K (see Fig. <a
href="#Fig3">3</a>), the Cr evaporation results in the transformation of the </span>&#947;-phase into the Al-rich &#946;-phase in the region
contiguous to the oxide/coating interface (further denoted as &#946;*-zone), and a
roughening of the parent coating surface. A corresponding annealing treatment
of the coating <i>with</i> native oxide showed that the formation of the &#946;*-zone upon heating is
suppressed in the presence of a native oxide.</p>

<h4>Initial Segregation and Subsequent Distribution of Y</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>As evidenced by e.g. Figs. 1c and 2c, the YNi-rich intermetallic
precipitates in the Cr-evaporation-induced &#946;*-zone, have dissolved upon the oxidation of the sputtered-clean

<script>comment();</script><p>The formation of a Y-depleted &#946;*-zone, in combination
with a strong Y-enrichment at the outer oxide surface, is suppressed by the
presence of a native oxide on the coating at the onset of the oxidation.
Instead, segregated Y becomes concentrated as large pegs of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>
[7] (and some AlYO<sub>3</sub> [8]), extending from the outer surface along &#947;/&#946; phase boundaries into
the &#947;+&#946; interface region of the
coating (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig2">2b</a>). Consequently,
the developing </span>&#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
[9] layer is less compact (i.e. less dense) and less uniform of thickness than
for the sputtered-clean coating (cf. compare Fig. <a href="#fig1">1b</a> and <a href="#fig1">c</a>).</span> </span></p>

<script>comment();</script><p>The observed differences in oxide-layer
morphology and constitution, for the oxidation of the coating with or without a
native oxide at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, are attributed to the differences in
the extent of Y segregation at the onset of the oxidation, and the resulting
distribution of Y within the initially grown oxide layer. For example, the
presence of initially segregated Y at the coating surface, as well as
Cr-evaporation-induced roughening of the coating surface, may result in a
higher density of heterogeneous nucleation sites for the formation of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
[10, 11]. Consequently, the coalescence of the initial &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
crystallites into a closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer is promoted for the oxidation of
the sputtered-clean coating (cf. compare Fig. <a href="#fig1">1b</a> and <a href="#fig1">c</a>).</span> </span></p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the oxidation of the coating with

surface (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5c</a>)

indicating that virtually no Y segregation has occurred at the onset of the
oxidation. Instead, subsequently segregated Y becomes concentrated as large

extending from the oxide/coating interface (i.e. below the initially grown

Secondary electron micrograph and (<b>b</b>) corresponding backscattered
electron micrograph of a cross-section of the NiCoCrAlY
coating after oxidation in a furnace for 1 hour at 1373 K and <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>� = 2&times;10<sup>4</sup>
Pa. The AlY-oxide pegs at the oxide/coating interface
have been indicated by the black arrows. (<b>c</b>) Measured XPS spectra (after
correction for X-ray satellites and inelastic background) recorded from the
oxidised surface before and after the oxidation. Only Al-oxide with small
amounts of (Ni, Al, Cr)-oxide is detected at the oxidised surface. (<b>d</b>)
Normalised intensity of Al, Co, Y, Cr and Ni as a function of depth below the
oxide surface, as resolved from the measured sputter-depth profile recorded
from the upper part of the grown oxide layer using SIMS. The surface-adjacent
part of the top oxide layer, corresponding to the <i>dark </i>layer in (a), is
constituted of Al, Cr, Ni and Co (with a strong Al-enrichment at its very
surface), whereas the upper part of bottom oxide layer, corresponding to the <i>bright</i>
layer in (a), consists of Al with small amounts of Cr and Y.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>It is concluded that the initial
segregation of Y to the coating surface at the onset of the high-temperature
oxidation of the coating, as well as the resulting Y-enrichment at the outer
surface of the developing oxide layer, are promoted at
low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> and in the absence of a native oxide layer. Then, the
subsequent formation of large pegs of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>
(and some AlYO<sub>3</sub>) at the oxide/coating interface is suppressed.</p>

<h4>Internal Oxidation of Y</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>For all three oxidation treatments,
internal oxidation of the YNi-rich intermetallic precipitates, which are concentrated at
original &#947;/&#946; phase boundaries in the
coating, has occurred through inward diffusion of oxygen along original &#947;/&#946; phase boundaries (Fig. <a
href="#Fig1">1</a>). XRD analysis of the oxidised specimens in combination with
EDS analysis of their cross-sections in the SEM, show that these internal
oxides are predominantly constituted of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>
with some AlYO<sub>3</sub>. The internal oxidation of the YNi-rich
precipitates in the coating results from the higher inward flux of oxygen along
original </span>&#947;/&#946; phase boundaries as compared to the outward flux of Y along these
boundaries (as determined by the rate of dissolution and subsequent
segregation). </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the oxidations at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
in a UHV chamber, SEM analysis of the oxide/coating cross-sections often
reveals paths of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (and some AlYO<sub>3</sub>)
running from the oxide/coating interface through the developing &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>layer
to an outer surface, which is mainly constituted of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
(cf. Figs. <a href="#fig2">2b</a>
and <a href="#Fig2">c</a>).</span> These features are confined to positions
above original </span>&#947;/&#946; phase boundaries, where dissolution and subsequent segregation of Y
to the coating surface, as well as internal oxidation of YNi-rich
intermetallic precipitates, has occurred. These YAl-oxide paths are much less pronounced for the oxidation
of the <i>sputtered-clean</i> coating at <i>low</i> <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
(which initially forms an Y-depleted &#946;*-zone) and were not observed
for the oxidation of the coating <i>with</i> native oxide at <i>high</i> <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
(for which initial Y segregation is hindered). The presence of these YAl-oxide paths within the grown oxide layer (for the
oxidations at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>) indicate that dissolution and
segregation of Y along original &#947;/&#946; phase boundaries to the oxide/coating interface, followed by
outward diffusion of Y along oxide grain boundaries to the oxide surface, has
occurred during the oxidation. The outward diffusion of Y through the oxide is
driven by the oxygen potential gradient across the developing oxide layer [11,
12]. However, an additional driving force must be responsible for the
dissolution and segregation of Y from the interior of the coating to the
oxide/coating interface, since this process also takes place in the absence of
an oxygen potential gradient (i.e. upon annealing in UHV; see Sec. 3.2). In the absence of an oxygen
potential gradient, the dissolution and segregation of Y to an alloy surface is
generally attributed to the high lattice strain energy associated with the size
mismatch of the relatively large Y atoms within the alloy [10, 11]. The outward
diffusion of Y along alloy and oxide grain boundaries hinders the outward
transport of other, less reactive cations along these
grain boundaries, and inhibits the formation and growth of voids at the
oxide/coating interface [11, 12].</p>

<h4>Distribution of Non-Protective Oxide Phases</h4>

<script>comment();</script><p>After
continued oxidation (i.e. after 4 h) of the sputtered-clean coating at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>,
the resulting oxide layer is constituted of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>with the initially segregated and subsequently oxidised
Y located at its surface (see Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>); the </span>&#946;*-zone has already
partially transformed back into the &#947;-phase due to the oxidation-induced Al depletion. This
contrasts with the oxidation of the coating <i>with</i> native oxide at
high <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, for which a doubled-layered oxide structure has
evolved (see Figs. <a href="#fig5">5a</a> and <a href="#Fig6">6</a>).</span> As revealed by XRD, SEM, TEM,
XPS analysis and SIMS depth profiling (see Figs. <a href="#fig5">5</a> and <a
href="#Fig6">6</a>), the top oxide layer (i.e. the dark layer in Fig. <a
href="#fig5">5a</a>) has a relatively fine-grained, equiaxed
structure and is constituted of (spinel) oxides of
Al, Cr, Ni and Co with a strong Al-enrichment at its very surface. The bottom
oxide layer (i.e. the bright layer in Fig. <a href="#fig5">5a</a>) has a
denser, coarse-grained, columnar structure and consists of only </span>&#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
with small amounts of Cr and Y. The strong cathodoluminescence of the &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> bottom
layer, as observed with the secondary electron detector (Fig. <a
href="#fig5">5a</a>), indicates that the columnar</span> &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
grains are doped with Y (and Cr). The interface between the top and bottom
oxide layer is relatively sharp, whereas the interface between the &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
bottom layer and the coating is irregular due to the inward growth of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and the formation of large YAl-oxide pegs at the
oxide/coating interface by internal oxidation along original &#947;/&#946; boundaries. This
complies with the general view that the top oxide layer is grown mainly by the
outward diffusion of metal cations, whereas the
bottom oxide layer is grown predominantly by the inward diffusion of oxygen
anions through the &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer.</p>

<p align=center> <span style="background-color: #00FF00">Figure 6.</span> Transmission electron
micrograph of a cross-section of the NiCoCrAlY
coating after oxidation in a furnace for 0.5 hour at 1273 K and <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>� =
2&times;10<sup>4</sup> Pa. Local EDS analysis revealed that the evolved
double-layered oxide structure consists of a top oxide layer predominantly
constituted of Al, Ni, Co, and Cr at its <i>upper</i> part (position 3) and Al
and Cr at its <i>lower</i> part (position 2), and a relatively dense bottom
layer of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
(position 1). See text for details.</p>

<script>comment();</script><p>As follows from the above discussion, the
(micro)structure, morphology, constitution and chemical composition of the
initial, thermally grown oxide layer on a <i>M</i>CrAlY
bond coat is governed by its oxidation conditions (e.g. <i>T</i> and <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>),
as well as by its microstructure (e.g. Y-depleted &#946;*-zone) and surface
condition (e.g. native oxide). It was shown that the distribution of Y within
the coating, as well as within the developing oxide layer, is strongly
dependent upon the partial oxygen pressure and the presence of a native oxide
on the coating surface at the onset of oxidation. In general, it can be
concluded that the rate of formation of a protective &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer, with an Y-enrichment at its very surface, is
enhanced for the oxidation of a <i>M</i>CrAlY coating
at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> and
in the absence of a native oxide layer. The influence
of the Y-distribution within the initially grown oxide layer on the long-term
performance of the entire coating system (i.e. superalloy
substrate | bond coat | TBC; see Sec. 1) in service is still unknown. It is expected that a
well-defined pre-treatment, consisting of controlled annealing and subsequent
oxidation (prior to deposition of a TBC in the fabrication process), can have a
beneficial effect on the durability of the coating system during service. This
will be investigated by the present authors in the near future.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<script>comment();</script><p>For the oxidation of a <i>M</i>CrAlY
coating at 1373 K, the exclusive formation of a continuous, closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer with a strong Y-enrichment at its outer surface is promoted at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>
and in the absence of a native oxide. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>A lower <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> reduces the activity of
oxygen at the oxide/coating interface during the initial, fast oxidation stage,
thereby promoting the coalescence of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
crystallites into a closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer.
Consequently, the duration of the initial, very fast oxidation stage and its
associated Al depletion from the coating, as well as the formation of
less-protective (spinel) oxides of Cr, Ni and Co, are
strongly suppressed. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>In the absence of a native oxide and at low <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>,
the initial segregation of Y to the coating surface is promoted, resulting in a
strong Y-enrichment at the developing oxide-layer surface and a limitation of
the subsequent formation of large pegs of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>
(and some AlYO<sub>3</sub>) at the oxide/coating interface. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Upon the high-temperature oxidation of a<i>MCrAlY</i>
coating, internal oxides of Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and AlYO<sub>3</sub>
are grown at the &#947;/&#946; phase boundaries by internal oxidation of YNi-rich
intermetallic precipitates. </p>

<script>comment();</script><p>Heating and subsequent annealing of a <i>M</i>CrAlY coating at 1373 K in UHV results in the fast
formation of a Y-depleted, single-phase &#946;-zone in the region contiguous to the oxide/coating interface due to
extensive Cr evaporation and strong Y segregation. The initial Y segregation
and/or Cr-evaporation-induced roughening of the coating surface may promote the
heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, thereby promoting the coalescence of
the initial &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
crystallites into a closed &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer.</p>
