<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Stochastic resonance (SR) is a generic term to describe the
  phenomenon which is manifest in nonlinear systems whereby a &#150; generally
  feeble &#150; input information (such as a weak signal) can be amplified, and
  optimized, by the assistance of noise. In this paper, some basic ideas
  concerning a non-coated passive metal corrosion system are discussed, and the
  theory of SR is used to interpret the mechanism of the passivity.</p>

<H3>&sect;3 Introduction</H3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The concept of stochastic resonance was originally put
  forward in seminal papers by Benzi and collaborators[1~3] wherein they address
  the problem of the periodically recurrent ice ages. A statistical analysis of
  continental ice volume variations over the last 10<sup>6</sup> yr shows that
  the glaciation sequence has an average periodicity of about 10<sup>5</sup> yr.
  This conclusion is intriguing because the only comparable astronomical time
  scale in earth dynamics known so far is the modulation period of its orbital
  eccentricity caused by planetary gravitational perturbations. The ensuing
  variations of the solar energy influx (or solar constant) on the earth surface
  are exceedingly small, about 0.1%. The question climatologists (still) debate
  is whether a geodynamical model can be devised, capable of enhancing the
  climate sensitivity to such a small external periodic forcing. Stochastic
  resonance provides a simple, although not conclusive answer to this question.
  In the model of Benzi et al, the global climate is represented by a
  double-well potential, where one minimum represents a small temperature
  corresponding to a largely ice-covered earth. The small modulation of the
  earth&#146;s orbital eccentricity is represented by a weak periodic forcing.
  Short-term climate fluctuations, such as the annual fluctuations in solar
  radiation, are modelled by Gaussion white noise. If the noise is tuned
  suitably, synchronised hopping between the cold and warm climate could
  significantly enhance the response of the earth&#146;s climate to the weak
  perturbations caused by the earth&#146;s orbital eccentricity, according to
  arguments by Benzi et al.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;4 The processes of corrosion are most complicated, showing
  affluent nonlinear phenomena. One example of this is metal passivity. Because
  of the appearing of passivity, the corrosion processes of metals are
  inhibited. So, it&#146;s worth of the attention for corrosionists to the
  phenomenon of passivity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;5 The most wide-spread and important theories of passivity
  are the thin-film theory and the absorption theory. In the thin-film theory,
  it is assumed that the cause of passivity is the formation of a thin film on
  the surface of metals because of the coherent reaction between metals and its
  environment. Lots of experimental evidence has confirmed this kind of
  assumption. But, it is also argued that, to promote the corrosion-resistance
  of metals, the film must be thorough, completely covering the surface of
  metals. On the other hand, some steady metals without film on their surfaces,
  e.g. Pt, have also the property of passivity. Then, how to explain this? The
  absorption theory, therefore, offers another explanation for passivity
  phenomenon. For example, when 6% of the surface area of Pt in HCl solution is
  covered with oxygen, its potential moves upwards 0.12V, and its corrosion rate
  is reduced to 10% of its original rate[4].</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;6 Unfortunately, there are still questionable points inside
  the absorption theory. Scientists failed to give a satisfactory explanation
  concerning why so little absorption can lead to complete passivity of a metal.
  Modern nonlinear science theory have undergone an extraordinary growth in last
  few decades, and this has, in turn, been changing the general views of human
  being about the world. Hence, human being has now got deeper and deeper
  understanding about the nature of the world. The complexity of corrosion
  process requires corrosionists to use modern nonlinear science theory to
  explore the inner rules of corrosion process.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;7 In this paper, after the simple description of some basic
  ideas of SR theory, the characteristics of corrosion process for a passive
  system is discussed, and SR theory is tried to the interpretation of the
  mechanism of the passivity along the absorption theory.</p>
<H4>&sect;8 Simple Description of SR Theory[5]</H4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The mechanism of SR is simple to explain. Consider a
  heavily damped particle mass <i>m</i> and viscous friction <img src="{{ $htmURL }}image67.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="21">,
  moving in a symmetric double-well potential V(x). The particle is subject to
  fluctuational forces that are, for example, induced by coupling to a heat
  bath. Such a model is archetypal for investigations in reaction-rate
  theory[6]. The fluctuational forces cause transitions between the neighboring
  potential wells with a rate given by the famous Kramers rate[7]i.e.,</p>
  <p align="CENTER"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image68.gif" WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="56">(1)</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">with <img src="{{ $htmURL }}image69.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="31">being the squared angular
  frequency of the potential minima at <img src="{{ $htmURL }}image70.gif" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="30">, and <img src="{{ $htmURL }}image71.gif" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="33">the
  squared angular frequency at the top of the barrier, located at x<sub>b</sub>,
  &Delta;V is the height of the potential barrier
  separating the two minima. The noise strength D=k<sub>B</sub>/T is related to
  the temperature T.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;9 If we apply a weak periodic forcing to the particle, the
  double-well potential is tilted asymmetrically up and down, periodically
  raising and lowering the potential barrier. Although the periodic forcing is
  too weak to let the particle roll periodically from one potential well into
  the other one, noise induced hopping between the potential wells can become
  synchronized with the weak periodic forcing. This statistical synchronization
  takes place when the average waiting time T<sub>K</sub>(D)=1/r<sub>K</sub>
  between two noise-induced inter-well transitions is comparable with <i>half</i>
  the period T<sub>O</sub> of the periodic
  forcing. This yields the time-scale matching condition for stochastic
  resonance i.e.,</p>
  <p align="CENTER">2 T<sub>K</sub>(D)= T<sub>O</sub> (2)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;10 In short, stochastic resonance in a symmetric double-well
  potential manifests itself by a synchronization of activated hopping events
  between the potential minima with the weak periodic forcing[8]. For a given
  period of the forcing T<sub>O</sub>, the
  time scale matching can be fulfilled by tuning the noise level D<sub>max</sub>
  to the value determined by Eq. (2).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;11 In summary, the effect requires three basic ingredients, (i)
  an energetic activation barrier or, more generally, a form of threshold; (ii)
  a weak coherent input; (iii) a source of noise that is inherent in the system,
  or that adds to the input. Given these features, the response of the system
  undergoes resonance-like behavior as a function of the noise level; hence the
  name stochastic resonance. The underlying mechanism is fairly simple and
  robust. As a consequence, SR has been observed in a large variety of systems,
  including chemical reactions[9].</p>
<h4>&sect;12 The Tentative Explanation of the Mechanism of Passivity
  Phenomenon Using SR Theory</h4>
  <ol>
  <p><strong>1. The two stable steady-state characteristic of a passive system</strong></p>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">For a passive metal corrosion system, the typical anodic
    polarization curve can be shown as figure 1.</p>
    <p align="CENTER"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image72.gif" WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="159"></p>
<p align="CENTER">&sect;13 Fig.1 The typical anodic polarization curve for a passive
    metal corrosion system</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;14 In figure 1, the Region OA is active dissolution area,
    the polarization current increase with the improvement of polarization
    potential; Region AB is temporary area, the polarization current decreases
    rapidly with the improvement of polarization potential; Region BC is in
    passive state, the polarization current shows little increase with the
    improvement of polarization potential, the metal shows little corrosion,
    almost none; with the further increase of polarization potential, there will
    possibly again be some increase of polarization current, so, the Region of
    CD can be called as trans-passive area.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;15 In certain circumstance, the determining factor for the
    state of a passive metal corrosion system is the cross-point between anodic
    polarization curve and cathodic polarization curve. The actual corrosion
    system is an typical nonlinear dynamics system. This can be shown as figure
    2[10]</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image73.gif" WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="170"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image74.gif" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="164"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image75.gif" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="165"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;16 Fig.2 The schematic representation for the corrosion
    state of a passive metal corrosion system &lt;Comment from RAC - it is
    rather messy using three separate images for these three diagrams - could
    you combine them onto one?&gt;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;17 In figure 2 (b), it is shown that, there are three
    cross-points between anodic polarization curve and cathodic polarization
    curve. This points out that this nonlinear dynamics system has three state,
    among them, A and C are steady state, B is unsteady. Because of the
    nonlinear characteristic of the system and the inner stochastic force
    (electrochemical noise or, ECN)[11~13], the system will not possibly be in
    B, so this system is a kind of two stable steady-state nonlinear system, it
    has just two possible state: when at A, active dissolving (showing as
    figure2a); when at C, passive state (shown as figure 2c).</p>
  </ol>
<p>&sect;18 <strong>2. The source of noise[11~13]</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">From current knowledge, there are possibly three kind of
    sources which generated noise: the noise generated by the thermal vibrations
    of the equivalent circuit of underlying electrochemical processes of
    corrosion; the noise generated by the electrolyte solution; and most
    importantly, the noise generated by the process of absorption-desorption
    which will generate noise with large enough energy for SR to take place.</p>
  </ol>
<p>&sect;19 <strong>3. The source of &quot;signal&quot;</strong></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">From the discussions above, it is seen that whether the
    corrosion system is in the state of passivity or not lies in the shape of
    cathodic polarization curve. While, the process of the reduction of
    absorbents was controlled by its absorption degree on the surface of metals.
    When surface absorption increases, polarization current develops quickly
    with polarization potential moving toward cathodic direction. This stands
    for a perturbation signal to the two stable steady-state nonlinear system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;20 Now, we can make some tentative explanations. Although the
  absorption degree of absorbents on the surface of metal was very small, this
  weak &quot;signal&quot; can be modulated by the two stable steady-state
  nonlinear system and the noise, there will be a stochastic resonance response,
  a kind of mechanism that noise energy moves on to signal energy, to take
  place. Therefore, the corrosion system changes its state from active to
  passive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;21 Due to the nonlinear characteristic of corrosion system,
  and the inherent stochastic force (ECN) of corrosion process, it is promising
  to discover more and understand deeply about the inner rules of corrosion
  process with the further study of the effect of stochastic force to the
  nonlinear system.</p>
<h4>&sect;22 Conclusion</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Passive metal corrosion system can be treated as a two
  stable steady-state nonlinear dynamics system. Due to the process of
  absorption-desorption of the absorbents, noise with large enough energy can be
  produced, and the absorption of reduction agents can also change the shape of
  cathodic polarization curve, this equals to a perturbation signal to the
  system. Because of the coherent effect among the system, signal and noise,
  stochastic resonance may take place. Therefore, the formation of the passive
  state of metal corrosion system may be due to this kind of effect.
  Experimental verifications are now under considering.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;23 The complexity of the process of metal corrosion tells us
  that, there are plenty of nolinear process inside the system, and the process
  can produce much stochastic forces (ECN). It is certain that the study of the
  effect of stochastic force to the nonlinear system can be a help in the
  research of metal corrosion.</p>
