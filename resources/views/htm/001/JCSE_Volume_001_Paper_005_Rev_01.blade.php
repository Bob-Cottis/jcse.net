<h4>&sect;1 ABSTRACT</h4>
  <p>Crevice corrosion is a dangerous form of localized corrosion that leads to
  the attack of creviced (covered) areas of metallic structures, where the
  access of oxygen is difficult. In this work it is shown that laser surface
  alloying of Al7175-T7351 with chromium can modify the situation since surfaces
  more corrosion resistant than the substrate alloy are obtained. Therefore, if
  this treatment is applied to the creviced area, crevice corrosion is avoided.</p>
<h4>&sect;2 INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p>Crevice corrosion is a dangerous form of localized corrosion that usually
  takes place in a small volume of stagnant solution trapped in crevices formed
  in components of engineering structures in service (gaskets, lap joints,
  deposits, narrow spaces between bolts and metallic surfaces, etc.).</p>
<p>&sect;3 The mechanism for crevice corrosion is very often described as consisting
  of four stages [1,2]:</p>
    <ul>
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><li>Stage 1, where the oxygen inside the crevice is depleted due to its
        consumption in the cathodic reaction. The depletion of oxygen inside the
        crevice makes the metal there an anode relatively to the metal outside
        the crevice by forming a differential aeration cell. This cell
        accelerates the anodic process of metal dissolution inside the crevice
        and exists through all the stages of crevice corrosion.</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><li>Stage 2, where there is an increase of the acidity and chloride
        content inside the crevice due to the hydrolysis of the cations
        originated in the anodic process. The geometry of the crevice makes the
        exchange of solution between the inside and outside of the crevice
        difficult, creating a local solution chemistry inside the crevice.</li>
<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><li>Stage 3, when the local solution inside the crevice attains a critical
        value of pH that corresponds to the breakdown of the passive film.</li>
      <li>Stage 4, that corresponds to the propagation of the attack.</li>
    </ul>
<p>&sect;7 Taking into consideration the galvanic character of crevice corrosion, and
  the localized effect of the phenomenon, involving usually small anodic areas
  (inside the crevice), it seems to be plausible for overcoming the problem, to
  modify the surface of the metal inside the crevice in a way that it becomes
  more noble than the metal outside the crevice.</p>
<p>&sect;8 Laser surface treatments, such as laser surface alloying [3,4] and laser
  surface cladding [5,6] could be adequate to this aim. Alloying or cladding the
  inside part of the crevice, forming surface alloys more noble than the
  substrate alloy, can reduce or even eliminate crevice corrosion.</p>
<p>&sect;9 Moreover localized processing is one of the most important advantages of
  the laser surface treatment.</p>
<p>&sect;10 In this work the effect of adding chromium to an aluminium alloy (Al
  7175-T7351) in the crevice area was studied. Chromium was chosen because it is
  one of the alloying elements that improves the corrosion resistance of
  aluminium and its alloys. However as its solubility in equilibrium conditions
  is very low, to have a certain amount of chromium dissolved in the alloy it is
  necessary to use techniques that allow for the formation of metastable alloys.
  Among these techniques are the laser treatments, since they are rapid melting
  and solidifying processes.</p>
<h4>&sect;11 EXPERIMENTAL</h4>
  <p>The Al7175-T7351 samples (60x20x10 mm) after being sand blasted were laser
  alloyed with chromium in an area of 15x20 mm. A 2 kW CO<sub>2</sub> laser was
  used [7]. The spot size of the laser beam was 5 mm and the alloy moved under
  the laser beam at a transverse speed of 5 mm/s.</p>
<p>&sect;12 The alloying powder with a composition of 25% Cr + 75% Al was fed to the
  substrate at a rate of 0.03 g/s. To obtain a uniform composition and eliminate
  porosity and cracks in the surface layer the specimens after alloying were
  remelted. The transverse speed of the specimens during this operation was 10
  mm/s.</p>
<p>&sect;13 The average composition of the laser alloyed layer was
  Al-5Cr-1.7Cu-0.7Mg-3.1Zn.</p>
<p>&sect;14 The creviced specimen consisted of the Al7175-T7351 sample, mounted in
  epoxy resin, and a Perspex plate, covering the laser treated part of the
  surface, and separated from it by a hard plastic frame with a thickness of 0.1
  mm, Fig. 1. The limits of the crack were sealed with epoxy resin, and the
  dimension of the crevice was 15x20x0.1 mm.</p>
<p>&sect;15 The specimen was immersed in naturally aerated 3% NaCl solution.</p>
<p>&sect;16 After the crevice corrosion tests the corrosion morphology was observed by
  optical microscopy.</p>
<p align="left">&sect;17 Identical crevice corrosion tests on untreated aluminium were
  carried out in the same experimental conditions for comparisonpurpose.</p>

<p align="center">&sect;18 Fig. 1 - Scheme of the artificial crevice specimen</p>
<p>&sect;19 In order to simulate what happens in the initial stage of the crevice
  process, the potential of the Al7175-T7351 aluminium alloy was monitored in
  naturally aerated 3% NaCl solution and the potential of the chromium alloyed
  alloy (AlCr) was monitored in deaerated 3% NaCl solution. These measurements
  were performed on 15 x 20 x 10 mm uncreviced specimens relatively to a
  saturated calomel electrode (SCE) using a HP 3478A multimeter connected to a
  HP 9121 computer.</p>
<p>&sect;20 All the samples were mounted in epoxy resin and carefully polished with
  emery paper to 800 grit before the tests.</p>
<h4>&sect;21 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h4>
  <h5>Potential monitoring</h5>
  <p align="left">Fig. 2 shows the variation with time of the corrosion
  potential of Al 7175-T7351 alloyed with chromium (AlCr) in deaerated 3% NaCl
  solution (curve A). In the same figure the variation of the potential with
  time of the same alloy in aerated 3% NaCl solution is presented (curve B).</p>

  Al Cr in deaerated 3% NaCl solution, <i>B</i>. Al 7175 in naturally aerated 3%
  NaCl solution</p>
<p>&sect;23 The corrosion potential of the 7175 aluminium alloy increases at the
  beginning and then reaches a relative stable value of about -0.82 V. The
  corrosion potential of AlCr also increases with time reaching a stable value
  of -0.68 V, which is 0.14 V higher than that of the Al 7175. Then the AlCr
  alloy is cathodic relatively to the Al 7175 alloy.</p>
<h5>&sect;24 Immersion tests</h5>
  <p align="left">Using the crevice specimen described in the experimental
  section an immersion test was carried out on the specimen partially laser
  treated for one week in quiescent solution. The observation of the specimens
  shows that inside the crevice where the substrate is alloyed with Cr (AlCr),
  the surface is still bright, as before the test, i.e. uncorroded. Outside the
  crevice (untreated part) the Al 7175 alloy suffered severe pitting corrosion,

  specimen outside the crevice, after immersion in 3% NaCl solution for 1 week (<a href="images/fig3l.jpg">larger

<p align="left">&sect;26 The same crevice test was performed on a crevice specimen of
  plain Al 7175, without laser alloying in any part of the specimen. After the
  test the alloy inside the crevice is severely corroded, as shown in Fig. 4.
  The alloy outside the crevice is not corroded. This case is the normal crevice
  corrosion situation where the smaller area inside the crevice works as anode,
  compared to the larger area outside the crevice that works as cathode.</p>

  crevice after immersion in 3% NaCl solution for 1 week (<a href="images/fig4l.jpg">larger

<p align="left">&sect;28 A small ratio (&lt;&lt;1) of anodic area/cathodic area is very
  unfavourable from the galvanic corrosion point of view, since as the system is
  electrically isolated, there should be an equality between the current leaving
  the anodic area and the current entering in the cathodic area, which has as
  consequence a large anodic current density, i.e., a large corrosion rate. The
  area inside the crevice (anode) corrodes much faster than if the crevice was
  not present.</p>
<p>&sect;29 The experimental results have shown that laser alloying the area inside the
  crevice with chromium was able to change this situation, avoiding crevice
  corrosion.</p>
<p>&sect;30 The explanation for this fact becomes clear if the processes involved in
  laser alloying and crevice corrosion initiation are considered.</p>
<p>&sect;31 During laser surface alloying the substrate and the alloying elements are
  melted together and then they solidify rapidly, in comparison with the
  equilibrium solidifying process. The solid-liquid interphase moves more
  rapidly than in the equilibrium solidifying process and entraps more solute
  elements than it would do in the latter case, because they have less time to
  diffuse away.</p>
<p>&sect;32 As a consequence laser surface alloying of Al 7175 with
  chromium leads to the formation of a very fine microstructure, constituted by
  an <font face="Symbol">a</font>-Al matrix, which is much richer in chromium
  than in the alloy formed in equilibrium conditions [3], and intermetallic
  compounds dispersed in the matrix. The amount of chromium in the matrix
  depends on the amount of chromium used for alloying but it has been reported
  to be in some circumstances 30 times higher than in the alloy obtained in
  equilibrium conditions [3]. The intermetallic compounds formed during the
  alloying process were identified as <font face="Symbol">q</font>-Al7Cr, <font face="Symbol">h</font>-Al11Cr2
  and <font face="Symbol">e</font>-Al4Cr [7,8], and in the outermost layers of
  the treated specimens they are radially distributed around an aluminium rich
  central particle, forming an equiaxed cell structure, Fig. 5 [7].</p>

  and remelted layer [7] (<a href="images/fig5l.jpg">larger image</a>)</p>
<p align="left">&sect;34 In contact with air aluminium alloys are covered with a film
  that contains aluminium oxide and for the most of the cases oxides of the
  alloying elements. The film has defects (flaws, pores, etc) that act as pit
  and then crevice corrosion nuclei when the alloy is exposed to an environment
  susceptible to cause localized corrosion. In the pre-existing film defects the
  dissolution of the alloy is easier with consequent formation of Al<sup>3+</sup>,
  that suffering hydrolysis lowers the pH of the local solution. When the pH of
  this solution reaches a critical value, breakdown of the film occurs due to
  its dissolution, making the progress of corrosion possible [9]. At a
  microstructural level the pits in Al7175 alloy nucleate in the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-Al
  matrix as can be seen in Fig. 6. Therefore the presence there of solute
  elements that makes film breakdown more difficult will lower the tendency of
  the alloy to localized corrosion.</p>

<p align="center">&sect;35 Fig. 6 - Scanning electron micrography showing the pitting
  morphology on AlCr alloy [3] (<a href="images/fig6l.jpg">larger image</a>).</p>
<p>&sect;36 In Al-Cr alloys the passive film contains chromium oxide [10] which makes
  it less soluble in acid solution. Thus the breakdown of the film only occurs
  at a lower pH, making the onset of corrosion more difficult.</p>
<p>&sect;37 The chromium alloyed part of the specimen (crevice region) becomes, thus,
  more corrosion resistant to localized attack than the untreated alloy,
  avoiding crevice corrosion inside the covered area. Outside the crevice the
  extent of the attack (pitting) would be influenced by the crevice geometry
  that affects the partial potential drop down the crevice and hence the
  available cathodic area and the bulk solution conductivity. However this
  aspect is beyond the scope of this paper that deals only with crevice
  corrosion.</p>
<h4>&sect;38 CONCLUSIONS</h4>
  <p>Laser surface alloying of Al 7175-T 7351 alloy with chromium produces
  surfaces more resistant to localized corrosion than the substrate alloy. If
  the part of the component of the structure that is prone to crevice corrosion
  is alloyed, crevice corrosion can be avoided. As laser surface processing is
  specially adequate for treating small areas there is an enormous potential in
  this technology to modify the crevice corrosion behaviour of materials
  susceptible to this type of corrosion, particularly when crevices of small
  size are present.</p>
