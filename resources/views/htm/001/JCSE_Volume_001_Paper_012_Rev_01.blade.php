<h3>&sect;1 <b>Abstract</h3>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Dimethylmercury (DMM) has been discovered to be one of the
  organomercury compounds in natural gas, besides mercury metal. The effect of
  the DMM on the corrosion of carbon steel and aluminium metal was rather
  frightening, as compared to that of elemental mercury or mercuric chloride,
  which is well-known as a severely corrosive agent. The results showed that DMM
  in methanol or petroleum ether as solvent gave similar corrosion patterns to
  the elemental Hg solution. It revealed uniform corrosion characteristics on carbon steel
  and pitting appearance on aluminium. The higher the DMM concentration or the
  higher reaction temperature, the more severe corrosion occurred because of the
  higher elemental Hg concentration generated. Trace amounts of hydrogen chloride
  or hydrogen sulfide, which are also present in large
  quantities in natural gas,
  remarkably increased the corrosion potential of DMM on metal. Corrosion rate
  in the HCl+DMM solution was approximately 700 times faster than the one containing only DMM and 40
  times faster than the one containing only acid.</p>
  <b>
<h3>&sect;2 Introduction</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></b>It is well known that ppm amounts of elemental mercury
  in natural gas or condensates result in corrosion of equipment in oil or
  natural gas processing plants<sup><i>1-4</i></sup>. This is the main cause of
  equipment failure, especially failure of aluminium heat exchangers. The
  gas separation parts of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) at Map Ta
  Put has already encountered this problem, and had to be shut down for a period
  of 4-5 months resulting in lost income of
  over 10 million US dollars.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;3 The effects of elemental mercury in natural gas on
  corrosion was not reported until 1973 when a catastrophic failure of aluminium
  heat exchangers occurred at the Skikda liquefied natural gas plant in Algeria<sup><i>5</i></sup>.
  It was found that mercury corrosion caused the failure. After this discovery,
  a study of the Groningen field in Holland revealed similar corrosion in the
  gas-gathering system<sup><i>6-7</i></sup>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;4 Organic mercury compounds are typical mercury derivatives
  formed along with elemental mercury in natural gas<sup><i>8</i></sup>. Most of
  them are liquids which are extremely volatile<sup><i>9</i></sup>, and can not
  be trapped by mercury absorbants. To remove them, it is essential to decompose
  and convert organomercury to elemental mercury
  either by heat and/or catalyst<sup><i>10-11</i></sup>.
  From the thermochemical data collected<sup><i>12</i></sup> for mercuric
  chloride and dimethylmercury, mercuric chloride, which is a severe corrosive
  agent to metals, needs approximately 105 kcal/mol to break the bonds between
  mercury and chlorine atoms while the total energy required to break the bonds
  between methyl groups and mercury atom is approximately 58 kcal/mole to give
  elemental mercury. Therefore, dimethylmercury is believed to be a stronger
  corrosive agent.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;5 Decomposition of dimethylmercury can be only done by either
  pyrolyzing or photolyzing<sup><i>13</i></sup>. One example was to decompose
  dimethylmercury in the presence of oxygen to give elemental mercury. It was
  also found that dialkylmercury could be decomposed by a mineral acid like
  hydrochloric acid to give mercuric chloride<sup><i>14</i></sup>, and as a
  result might be able to corrode natural gas equipment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;6 To address the question of whether dimethylmercury will
corrode natural gas equipment, this research was thus focused on
  investigating corrosion of metals by organomercury compounds. Dimethylmercury,
  which is the most stable organomercury compound, was selected to study its
  corrosive behavior toward carbon steel and aluminium specimens.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT>  <h3 align="JUSTIFY">Materials</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Chemicals </i></b>: All chemicals were reagent grade and
  used as received. Dimethylmercury (Hg(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, DMM),
  mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) and elemental mercury (Hg) were purchased
  from Fluka Ag., Puriss. Petroleum ether (PE, bp. 80-100 &deg;C), cyclohexane, 1,4 dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide, benzene, and sodium sulfide
  (Na<sub>2</sub>S) were purchased from E. Merck (Germany). Absolute methanol
  (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), antimony trioxide, and diethyl ether were obtained from
  J.T.Baker. Chromic acid, trichloroethylene, and isopropyl alcohol were from
  AJAX Chemicals Co. Phosphoric (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), hydrochloric (HCl)/sulfuric
  (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) acids, and stannous chloride were obtained from
  Carlo Erba.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;8 <i><b>Specimen Samples </b></i>: Specimens, carbon steel
  and aluminium, were obtained from commercial carbon steel reinforcement bars
  and commercial aluminium bars for architectural use. They were prepared and
  cleaned prior to use. The preparation and cleaning was according to
  ASTM-G1-72.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;9 <i><b>Measurements </b></i>: The compositions of both
  carbon steel and aluminium were analyzed by a Shimadzu QC-6 Vacuum Emission
  Spectrometer (Table 1). Corroded surfaces were inspected by a Scanning Electron
  Microscope (JEOL, JSM-35 CF).</p>

  <h3 align="JUSTIFY">Methods</h3>
<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">1. Specimen Preparation</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Commercial carbon steel/aluminium bars were cut to make
  short strips with dimensions of 11.2 x 25 x 2.75 mm for carbon steel
  and 12.3 x 25 x 3 mm for aluminium. A hole was then drilled in the
  strips near one end for mounting. The diameter of the hole was 3.5 mm for
  carbon steel and 5.0 mm for aluminium. A few of these strip coupons were
  chosen for elemental composition analysis by vacuum emission spectrometer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;12 Specimens were wetted and rubbed with a No. 120 abrasive
  paper until their surface was cleaned and smooth. The sizes of carbon steel
  and aluminium specimens became 11.1 x 24 x 2.75 mm and 12.0 x 24 x
  2.9 mm, respectively. All of the strip coupons were subsequently stamped with numbers on the upper left hand side near the hole. Coupons were then degreased
  by scrubbing with a bleach-free scouring powder, followed by rinsing with
  distilled water and a mixture of 1:1 ratio of methanol : diethyl ether, and
  finally dried with air. They were then weighed with
  an accuracy of 0.0001 g, and kept in a dessicator until experiments were
  started.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">2. Preparation of Corrosive Solution</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The minimum solution volume-to-specimen area ratio was 20
  ml/cm<sup>2</sup> of specimen surface, as recommended in ASTM A G31-72. The
  total solution volume was therefore fixed at 150 ml. The selected solvents
  were CH<sub>3</sub>OH and PE.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;14 a) <i>Hg Solution</i> : Since the solubility of elemental
  Hg in cyclohexane is about 3 ppm., 5 mg of Hg was thus weighed and dissolved
  in 1 liter of cyclohexane.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;15 b) <i>HgCl<sub>2</sub> Solution </i>: The selected solvents
  were used to dissolve HgCl<sub>2</sub>. The HgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration used
  was 150 ppm.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;16 c) <i>DMM Solution</i> : The same selected solvents were
  used to dissolve DMM at concentrations
  of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and
  250 ppm.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;17 d). <i>DMM + HCl Solution</i> : DMM concentrations, as set in
the method 2 c), were carried out, and 150 ppm of conc. HCl was added into each
flask containing either methanol or PE. The concentrated HCl was a 37% by wt.
solution, so introduction of HCl could thus not be separated from that of water.
The volumes of conc. HCl and DMM required to give 150 ppm concentration in 150
ml is on the order of 0.05 ml, therefore, the total solution volume did not
change significantly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;18 e) <i>DMM + H<sub>2</sub>S Solution</i> : Saturated H<sub>2</sub>S
  solution was prepared by passing H<sub>2</sub>S gas, which was synthesized
  from the reaction of conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>S
  powder, through the solvent for 1 h. at ambient temperature. In case of CH<sub>3</sub>OH,
  1000 mg of H<sub>2</sub>S is soluble in 943 ml of CH<sub>3</sub>OH<sup><i>15</i></sup>.
  The solubility of H<sub>2</sub>S in diethyl ether is 6.86 x 10<sup>-4</sup>
  mol/g while that of H<sub>2</sub>S in PE is 3.70 x 10<sup>-4</sup> mol/g <sup>16</sup>.
  Thus, in the case of PE, H<sub>2</sub>S gas was first dissolved into 10 ml of
  diethyl ether to saturation, then 140 ml of PE was added. The following corrosive solutions were prepared and studied using
  the method of&nbsp; ref. <i>16</i>:</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">- CH<sub>3</sub>OH or PE + saturated H<sub>2</sub>S</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">- CH<sub>3</sub>OH or PE + saturated H<sub>2</sub>S + 200 ppm
  DMM</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">- CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 300 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S solution + 200
  ppm DMM</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">- CH<sub>3</sub>OH or PE + 150 ppm HCl</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">- CH<sub>3</sub>OH or PE + 150 ppm HCl + 200 ppm DMM</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">3. Procedure</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">One pair of specimens was
  immersed in an Erlenmyer flask
  containing corrosive solution. The flask was closed loosely by a stopper to
  release gas produced during the corrosion process and prevent the suppression
  of the reaction. Temperatures studied were varied from -10 to 70 &deg;C with an increment of 20 &deg; C. At low
  temperatures, at or below 0 &deg;C, the flask was stored in a
  refrigerator, whereas at higher temperatures a temperature controlled bath was
  used. Duration of exposure depended on temperature. At low temperatures, the
  corrosion process took a long time, 700-1,000 h. while at ambient and higher
  temperatures, the reaction took place very rapidly, 74.6 mdd, and needed to be
  observed at all time.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">4. Specimen Cleaning after the Exposure</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The cleaning process was done by following the methods of
  ASTM G1-72 (Reapproved 1979). Procedures were varied depending on type of
  metal being cleaned, as follows;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;21 a) <i>Aluminium Specimen Cleaning </i>: Coupons were
  cleaned as well as possible with a plastic knife. Oily or greasy deposits were
  removed by soaking in trichloroethylene followed by the cleaning solution
  containing chromic acid, phosphoric acid, and water at 80 &deg;
  C for 25 min. The coupons were then rinsed with distilled water, isopropanol,
  and benzene. Finally, they were dried between paper towels and placed in a
  dessicator for 1 h. before weighing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;22 b) <i>Carbon Steel Specimen Cleaning </i>: After cleaning
  the coupons with plastic knife and soaking in trichloroethylene, remaining
  corrosion products needed to be removed by a bristle brush. They were then
  immersed in Clarke&#146;s solution at room temperature for 25 min.
  The specimens were rinsed with water followed by isopropanol and dried between
  paper towels followed by warm air drying.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">Results and Discussion</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The study concentrated on the surface appearances
  of the corroded aluminium and carbon steel specimens and the effect of various
  factors on corrosion. The surface appearance was identified using scanning
  electron microscope.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;24 a) <i><b>Hg Solution</b></i> : Figures 1 and 2
  corresponding to the effect of Hg solution on the surface of carbon steel and
  aluminium specimens, respectively, show how Hg could corrode both samples and
  how important DMM was to the system containing DMM.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a href="figure1.jpg"><img border="2" src="{{ $htmURL }}v1p12_2.gif" width="400" height="247"></a></p>

<p align="CENTER"><a href="figure2.jpg"><img border="2" src="{{ $htmURL }}v1p12_3.gif" width="400" height="248"></a></p>
<p>&sect;26 <b>Figure 2 SEM photograph showing
  pitting corrosion of aluminium
  in cyclohexane containing Hg&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;27 The corrosion occurred via the amalgamation of aluminium
  (eq.1)<sup>7</sup>. The amalgam is generally weaker than aluminium itself,
  thus easier to be attacked by water or CH<sub>3</sub>OH, see eq.2, and Hg
  generated would circulate to attack the aluminium again.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Hg + Al <font face="Symbol">�</font> <font face="Symbol">�</font>

  <font face="Symbol">�</font> 2Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 2Hg + 3H<sub>2</sub> (2)</p>
  </b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;28 The results appeared that at ambient temperature, the
  corrosion rates were 236.5 and 0.5 mdd (milligram/sq.decimeter/day) for
  carbon steel and aluminium, respectively. There were a lot of small pores
  distributed uniformly over the whole surface area of carbon steel specimen
  while a big black hole which seemed to be in the form of pitting appeared on
  the edge of aluminium specimen.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;29 b) <i><b>HgCl<sub>2</sub> Solution</b> </i>: This is
  another severely corrosive agent<sup>15</sup>. Equation 3 shows the
  decomposition of HgCl<sub>2 </sub>to elemental Hg when reacting with aluminium.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>2Al + 3HgCl<sub>2</sub> <font face="Symbol">�</font> <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  <font face="Symbol">�</font> <font face="Symbol">�</font> 2AlCl<sub>3</sub>
  + 3Hg (3)</p>
  </b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;30 It was found that for the reaction in CH<sub>3</sub>OH
  system aluminium corroded very severely whereas in the PE solution, no
  reaction took place. The corrosion rates conducted in the CH<sub>3</sub>OH and
  PE solution were 1,179.5 and 0.015 mdd, respectively. This is due to the fact
that HgCl<sub>2</sub> is very soluble in either water or alcohol as methanol or
ethanol, but not in non-polar solvents. PE is thus not a good solvent to
dissolve HgCl<sub>2</sub>. However, the solvent PE used in the experiment
contained 0.02% of water, as a result, very little reaction between aluminium
and HgCl<sub>2</sub> occurred in the PE system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;31 c) <i><b>DMM Solution</b></i> : In the flasks containing
  blank PE and MeOH solutions, after being immersed for 960 h. at ambient or 70
  &deg;C, specimens showed little corrosion, about 2 mg
  only, which is most likely due to scratch caused during the cleaning process,
since the corrosion measurement after conducting the blank cleaning also
resulted in almost the same weight loss, 2 mg. However, those immersed in the
solutions containing DMM (see Figures 3 and 4 ) showed similar corrosion patterns
to those immersed in the solution of
Hg in cyclohexane, in that carbon steel and aluminium gave
  uniform and pitting corrosion, respectively. The higher the DMM concentration,
  the more pores or pits were observed
on the specimens.</p>

<p>&sect;33 <b>Figure 4 SEM photograph showing
  pitting corrosion of Aluminium in CH<sub>3</sub>OH
  + DMM</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, DMM in MeOH seemed to be more corrosive than DMM in PE. The discoveries of Skinner<sup><i>12</i></sup> and
  Bass<sup><i>13</i></sup> could explain this phenomenon. The C-Hg bond of DMM
  is weak and can be easily broken by either photolysis or thermal dissociation
  in the presence of a hydrogen donor, such as alcohol, as can be seen from eq.
  4. The product is Hg metal which is a very corrosive species towards metals.
  PE is a non-polar solvent, and obviously not a hydrogen donor. Hg metal could
  thus not be formed. Corrosion on the specimen surface, however, could come
  from the presence of trace water in PE.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>CH<sub>3</sub>-Hg-CH<sub>3 </sub>+ MeOH </b><font face="Symbol">�</font>
  <font face="Symbol">�</font> <font face="Symbol">�</font> <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  <b>2 CH<sub>4</sub> + Hg (4)</p>
  </b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;34 The relationships of the corrosion rates versus temperature
  are illustrated in Figures 5 (for carbon steel) and 6 (for
  aluminium) for both MeOH and PE systems with and without DMM. The overall
  corrosion rates of carbon steel specimens were higher than those of aluminium
  specimens. Corrosion rates in solutions containing DMM increased significantly
  at temperatures above 30&deg; and 50 &deg;C for carbon steel and aluminium specimens, respectively, meaning that
  corrosion was a thermally activated process, as discovered by Skinner and
  Bass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&sect;35 It can also be seen in the case of the PE system, which contains trace
amounts of water. Water could then serve as a proton donor to DMM, as shown in
equation 5.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="{{ $htmURL }}untitled.gif" width="216" height="35">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)</p>
<p>Especially, at higher temperature, water molecules generate proton easier and
donate proton to DMM faster. As a result, the decomposition of DMM to mercury
metal, which is the cause of specimen corrosion, became easier.</p>

<p align="CENTER">&sect;37 <b>Figure 6 Effect of
  temperature on the corrosion rate of aluminium&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;38 As described previously, organomercury could react
  with mineral acids to form mercury salts which are also corrosive compounds<sup><i>14</i></sup>,
  for example, forming mercuric chloride from the reaction of organomercury with
  hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;39 Since natural gas also contains CO<sub>2</sub>, which could
  convert to carbonic acid in the presence of water, and H<sub>2</sub>S, the
  following studies were therefore undertaken to determine the effect of acid
  mixed in DMM solution on the corrosion rate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;40 As for the time dependence of the corrosion process, the
experiment was carried out for aluminium in the CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 150 ppm HCl system, with
and without DMM. The results are shown in Figure 7. It is obvious that DMM did
not play the most important role as the exposure time increased.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="figure6.gif"><img border="2" src="{{ $htmURL }}v1p12_6.gif" width="400" height="254"></a></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;41 <b>Figure 7 Weight loss of aluminium specimen in HCl
  solution with and without DMM&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;42 d) <i><b>DMM + HCl Solution</b> </i>: After adding 150 ppm
  HCl into the flasks containing various concentrations of DMM (0 to 250 ppm),
  the corrosion results were rather frightening, especially with the systems
  having CH<sub>3</sub>OH as solvent, which produced a much more corrosive
  reaction than those with PE as the solvent. The reason is that HCl can not be
  easily dissolved in PE as compared to CH<sub>3</sub>OH. However, for both
  carbon steel (Figure 8) and aluminium (Figure 9), the corrosion rate
  increased with increasing DMM concentration. Moreover, the corrosion
  appearance of aluminium specimens seemed to be more uniform than pitting since
  it was now distributed over the whole surface area whereas carbon steel still
  showed uniform appearance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;43 The temperature dependence of corrosion rates of solutions
  containing only HCl and HCl with DMM were different, as seen in Figures 10 and
11 for carbon steel and aluminium, respectively. In the case of
  corrosion by the solutions without DMM and having CH<sub>3</sub>OH as solvent,
  the rates were obviously much lower than the ones with DMM after the
  temperatures went up beyond 30 (for carbon steel) and 50&deg;C
  (for aluminium). This is simply because the DMM + HCl solutions contained not
  only corrosive HCl, mercury metal, but also mercuric chloride produced by the
  reaction of DMM/CH<sub>3</sub>OH and DMM/HCl as discovered by Skinner/Bass<sup><i>12-13</i></sup>
  and Dessy<sup><i>14</i></sup>, respectively. For the case of PE as the
  solvent, the rates were much lower, but still higher than the ones without HCl.
  This phenomenon could be explained by the poor solubility of HCl in PE in
  comparison to CH<sub>3</sub>OH. However, when temperature was elevated, the
solubility was increased from 1.53 x 10<sup>-3</sup> to 9.83 x 10<sup>-3 </sup>mole/l.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;50 As can be seen, the corrosion in
  the solutions containing
  both acid and DMM increased drastically (Figure 12). Both acids have the same
  potential to cause corrosion. The rates were extremely high when DMM was present
  together with the acids. For example, CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 150 ppm HCl + 200 ppm
  DMM corroded the specimens approximately 2675.9 mdd, which was 40 times more
  than that corroded by the solution without DMM. The CH<sub>3</sub>OH +
  saturated H<sub>2</sub>S + 200 ppm DMM solution was severe as well. The rate
  was almost 100 times faster than the one without DMM.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">&sect;52 As expected, when using PE instead of CH<sub>3</sub>OH, the
  corrosion rates were much lower. The system of PE + 300 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S +
  200 ppm DMM also gave a lower rate than that of PE + 150 ppm HCl + 200 ppm DMM.
  This is due to the content of water in HCl since HCl used in the system was
  37% of HCl in water while H<sub>2</sub>S used was in the form of gas purged
  into the PE solvent directly. The reactivity between H<sub>2</sub>S
  or HCl and DMM was then low. However, in gas phase as in natural gas, the gas
  molecules move around easier and faster, resulting in higher chance for those
  molecules to collide with each other. The reactivity between H<sub>2</sub>S
  and DMM should thus be better and the corrosion rate would be higher.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(53)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="JUSTIFY">Conclusions</h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></b>Based on the results of this study we find that
  organomercury compounds found in natural gas catalyze the corrosion of
  aluminium and steel components of gas pipelines and equipment in the presence
  of trace amounts of water. Decomposition of DMM leads to the formation of
  elemental mercury, which catalyzes corrosion by water. Furthermore, in the
  presence of small amounts of HCl or H<sub>2</sub>S the corrosive action of DMM
  is increased by several orders of magnitude and can lead to catastrophic
  failure in a relatively short time. These observations suggest that for
  natural gasses that contain mercury, steps should be taken to determine the
  presence or absence of organomercury compounds and eliminate them if possible.</p>
