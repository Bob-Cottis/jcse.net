  <h4>&sect;1 Introduction</h4>
  <p>Many current corrosion control methods use coatings and conversion layers
  which contain toxic and environmentally hazardous material, in particular
  hexavalent chromium compounds. There is a great need to find a non toxic
  replacement that is compatible with current industrial technologies.</p>
<p>&sect;2 Polyaniline has been found to have many interesting electrochemical
  properties, with some electronic conductivity on doping with acid. Its
  potential use in protecting metals from corrosion has been explored. with a
  number of papers on the electroactive polyaniline(PANI), with some claiming
  corrosion inhibition.(1-7).</p>
<p>&sect;3 Polyaniline exists in several different oxidation states, of which only the
  emeraldine salt form is conductive. Each of the forms can be reversibly
  interconverted through electron transfer, thereby enabling selective colour
  change and the switching from conductive to non conductive forms. The
  conductive form of polyaniline is the emeraldine salt, a green black powder.
  All other forms are insulating polymers.</p>
<p>&sect;4 The base form of the polymer in the emeraldine oxidation state (Y = 0.5) is

<p>&sect;5 The purpose of the study reported here is to explore the corrosion
  inhibiting properties of saturated aqueous extracts of PANI in neutral and
  slightly acid electrolytes on mild steel. Such methods have traditionally been
  used as the starting point for the investigation of the mechanism of
  inhibitive pigments for paints (9). A commercial chromate containing pigment,
  strontium chromate was used for comparative purposes.</p>
<h4>&sect;6 Experimental</h4>
  <h5>Materials and Methods</h5>
  <p>Square (1 x 1 cm) mild steel samples from Q Panel Co. were prepared by
  degreasing with ethanol. PANI was prepared at 0, 42 and 50% protonation using
  chemical synthesis; oxidation was by ammonium persulphate in hydrochloric acid
  according to (2).</p>
<p>&sect;7 The electrochemical methods exploited in these studies were the measurement
  of open circuit potential ( OCP ) and linear polarisation resistance (LPR) for
  bare mild steel after immersion in the saturated solutions and blanks. The
  equipment used was &quot; AutoLPR &quot; from ACM instruments.</p>
<p>&sect;8 The saturated solutions were 0%, 42%, 50% protonated polyaniline and
  strontium chromate in 0.01 molar NaCl.</p>
<p>&sect;9 Adding different states of polyaniline to 0.01 molar NaCl solution can
  cause changes of pH. A saturated solution of 0% protonated polyaniline
  produces a pH = 6.0, while the pH of the electrolyte changes for 42% and 50%
  protonated polyaniline to 4. Therefore blank solutions were made according to
  different acidic environments in order to compare with the PANI saturated
  solutions.</p>
<p>&sect;10 Testing solutions were 0.01 M NaCl at pH 6.0 its as- prepared pH and also a
  blank solution was prepared at pH 4.0. PANI solutions were prepared by shaking
  PANI powder in neutral 0.01 M NaCl until no further dissolved. The solutions
  were used in an unfiltered and stirred state.</p>
<h4>&sect;11 Results and Discussion</h4>
  <p>Open Circuit Potential (OCP), Linear Polarisation Resistance (LPR) and also
  visual observations for mild steel immersed in different media are shown in
  figures 1 to 2 and the accompanying colour plates. Visual observation made on
  the samples after eight hours exposures are summarised in Table 1 and are to
  be seen in the accompanying images. Of the samples exposed to NaCl only
  strontium chromate gave complete protection against corrosion. The corrosion
  process with 0% protonated polyaniline appeared to be localised.</p>

<p>&sect;13 In addition to visual observation two approaches of corrosion measurement
  were made during the exposure period. Measurements of corrosion potential
  suggest that the presence of the polyaniline on or near the surface of mild
  steel mild steel somehow seems to affect the corrosion process. Figure1 shows
  the corrosion potentials at various times for the samples exposed to the six
  test environments.</p>
<p>&sect;14 In all cases, after 8 hours exposure the samples immersed in strontium
  chromate, 0%, 42% and 50% protonated PANI exhibited corrosion potentials more
  noble than the corresponding control samples. The largest shifts in corrosion
  potential of polyaniline environments with exposure time were observed for the
  sample immersed in 0% protonated polyaniline, and were almost 100 mV. The
  samples immersed in 42 and 50% protonated PAn showed shifts to slightly more
  noble potentials with exposure time.</p>
<p>&sect;15 LPR measurements for the six samples after 8 hours exposure are shown in
  figure 2. As expected the LPR measured clearly show a substantial increase in
  polarisation resistance (some gave a twenty times increase) for the samples
  immersed in strontium chromate.</p>
<p>&sect;16 It can be seen that after 8 hours exposure the sample exposed to 0%
  protonated PANI exhibited corrosion resistance a little higher than the blank.
  However for the 42% and 50% protonated PANI, LPR is lower than the
  corresponding control sample.</p>
<p>&sect;17 Thus the evidence so far does not suggest that the unprotonated PANI is a
  successful corrosion inhibitor with an Rp increase of approximately double.
  Even so, substantial changes in the nature of the corrosion process may be
  seen, from uniform to pitting. With the other PANI systems studied (42% and
  50%), there was a reduction in Rp implying a corrosion stimulating effect.
  There was also a colour change in the uniform corrosion product. This may be
  due to the PANI in suspension altering the morphology of the rust deposit.<br>
  Although this work does not substantiate the previous claims of PANI being a
  corrosion inhibitor, it might be that when dispersed in a paint binder having
  different solubility characteristics, a different behaviour might be seen.</p>
<h4>&sect;18 Conclusions</h4>
  <p>As expected, the strontium chromate pigment gave excellent performance in
  this investigation. The 42 and 50% protonated PANI far from providing
  inhibition, actually appeared to increase the corrosion rate of mild steel.
  The 0% protonated PANI showed little inhibitive effect in terms of
  polarisation resistance, however its major effect was in the appearance of the
  corrosion processes, changing from uniform to a pitting regime. It may be that
  from this compound insufficient is dissolved in aqueous solution to provide
  complete inhibition and some means may be needed to place a higher
  concentration of this material in contact with the steel surface. The use of
  an organic polymeric dispersing medium is an obvious possibility.</p>
