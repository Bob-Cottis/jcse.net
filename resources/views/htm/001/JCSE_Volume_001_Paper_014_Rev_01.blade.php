  <h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>
  <p>The effects of sub-ppm levels of H<sub>2</sub>S, oxygen and the adsorbed
  water on the atmospheric corrosion of silver were studied. The concentration
  of H<sub>2</sub>S and the relative humidity affecting the tarnish rate were
  carefully controlled by permeation tube and monitoring the humidity. The
  quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), an <em>in situ</em> mass measuring
  technique, was used in order to measure the tarnish rate of silver in various
  exposure conditions and varying amounts of adsorbed water depending on
  relative humidity. The tarnish films were analyzed by XPS, the analyzed data
  were compared to the thermodynamic calculation used to predict the stable
  phases and the equilibrium potentials such as <font face="Symbol">f</font> <sub>Ag+/Ag</sub>,
  <font face="Symbol">f</font> <sub>O/O2-</sub> and pH. QCM results showed that
  oxygen was required for the sulfidation of silver exposed to 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S
  environments. This agrees with the predicted results that silver was not
  oxidized by hydrogen ion but by dissolved oxygen in the condensed water. In
  addition, the water adsorbed from the highly humidified environments enhanced
  the tarnish rate. This could be explained by the fact that the adsorbed water
  provided a medium for the oxygen, which oxidizes silver metal.</p>
<h3>&sect;2 Introduction</h3>
  <p>Silver has been used for electronic connector materials, solder, batteries
  and decorating materials because of its high electrical and thermal
  conductivities. Hence, the atmospheric corrosion of silver has been studied
  with an emphasis on the effect of humidity, the effect of gas and the kinetic
  mechanism.</p>
<p>&sect;3 Fiaud and Guinement<sup>1</sup> conducted indoor laboratory studies on the
  corrosion of silver in atmospheric environments of controlled relative
  humidity and pollutant gases, reporting that the corrosion product was silver
  sulfide and that the kinetic behavior conformed to a parabolic law. This does
  not agree with D. Simon&#146;s result<sup>2</sup> that the kinetic behavior
  conformed to a linear law. Kuhn and Kelsall<sup>3</sup> calculated the stable
  phase in Ag - H<sub>2</sub>S - O<sub>2</sub> and Ag - H<sub>2</sub>S - O<sub>2</sub>
  - H<sub>2</sub>O with their thermodynamic data, indicating that silver sulfate
  was stable instead of silver sulfide. This difference between Kuhn &amp;
  Kelsall&#146;s result and Fiaud &amp; Guinement&#146;s experimental result was
  explained by a large barrier for the formation of sulfate from sulfide.</p>
<p>&sect;4 In addition, the reaction process is controversial. Abbott<sup>4</sup>
  proposed that the sulfidation mechanism of silver exposed to hydrogen sulfide
  with ambient air was as follows:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image76.gif" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="58"></p>
<p>&sect;5 According to Graedel<sup>5</sup>, the sulfidation mechanisms were proposed
  to depend on the humidity. At low relative humidity, H<sub>2</sub>S gas
  reacted with silver metal directly, but at high relative humidity, dissolved
  species (HS<sup>-</sup>, S<sup>2-</sup>) from H<sub>2</sub>S gas reacted with
  silver (<i>i.e.,</i> Ag + H<sub>2</sub>S <font face="Symbol">�</font> Ag<sub>2</sub>S
  + H<sub>2</sub>(g)). Volpe and Peterson<sup>15</sup> exposed silver to dry air
  containing H<sub>2</sub>S (100ppb<font face="Symbol">~</font> 400ppb) in
  flowing gas and proposed the following reaction:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image77.gif" WIDTH="273" HEIGHT="51"></p>
<p>&sect;6 In addition, the dominant species for ionic conduction across the film is
  the silver ion since the diffusivity of the silver ions in silver sulfide is
  higher than that of the sulfide ions.<sup>13, 14</p>
  </sup>
<p>&sect;7 However, according to Phipps and Rice<sup>6</sup>, at low relative humidity
  (R.H. &lt; 40%, the adlayer thickness &lt; 1 monolayer), it is difficult to
  hydrate ions, but at high relative humidity (R.H.&lt; 65%, the adlayer
  thickness &lt; 3 monolayers), the behavior of the adsorbed water layer
  approaches that of a bulk water layer and electrochemical processes are
  possible.</p>
<p>&sect;8 In this study, to get a better understanding of the sulfidation process of
  silver in H<sub>2</sub>S environments, the effect of relative humidity, oxygen
  or H<sub>2</sub>S was studied with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). In
  addition, electrolyte thermodynamics were applied by assuming that the bulk
  thermodynamical properties are the same as the surface in order to explain the
  tarnishing process.</p>
<h3>&sect;9 Experimental</h3>
  <p>Silver was deposited on the front surface of a crystal by evaporation at
  Midwest Research Technologies, Inc. to a thickness of 5000 <font face="Courier New">�</font>
  . Before the deposition, the back surface was masked with crystal bond. Gold,
  previously deposited on the front side was stripped by aquaregia solution,
  cleaned with distilled water and acetone alternatively three times and dried
  with N<sub>2</sub> gas. The silver coated crystal was kept in desiccant before
  and after exposure. Before the exposure, the surface of silver was analyzed
  with XPS. Adsorbed species, such as adventitious hydrocarbon, (OH)<sub>ad</sub>
  and adsorbed oxygen were detected, but the oxide peak was not detected.</p>
<p>&sect;10 The sub-ppm level of concentration was obtained using a permeation tube. In
  order to get reproducible results, the concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S, the
  relative humidity and the temperature in the chamber were monitored during the
  exposure. The temperature of the chamber was kept at 25 <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  0.1 <font face="Symbol">�</font> C and the flow rate was 1 <font face="Times New Roman">l</font>
  /min. Purified air supplied by an air supply, or nitrogen (with 99.99% purity)
  from nitrogen cylinder was used as a carrier gas. The concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S
  was maintained at 5% during the exposure, while the concentrations of
  undesired gases in the purified air were less than 1ppb for SO<sub>2</sub>,
  0.1ppb for H<sub>2</sub>S, 1ppb for NO, 1ppb for NO<sub>2</sub>, 1ppb for O<sub>2</sub>,
  1.8<font face="Symbol">�</font> 10<sup>3</sup>ppb for CO<sub>2</sub> and
  100ppb for CO. The details of the mixed flowing gas system were described in
  other papers<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p>&sect;11 The quartz crystal microbalance, an<i> in situ</i> mass measurement
  technique with high mass sensitivity (<font face="Symbol">@</font> 10ng/cm<sup>2</sup>),
  was employed to monitor the mass change during exposure to part per billion
  pollutants and during the transition between wet and dry environments. The
  block diagram of the circuitry elements and the description of the particular
  circuitry employed are given elsewhere<sup>17</sup>. The circuitry designed
  for the oscillation of a 5 MHz quartz crystal was modified for the oscillation
  of a 6 MHz quartz crystal. In addition, the newly designed QCM was calibrated
  by the potentiostatic method with the following experimental conditions<sup>7</sup>:
  0.2M HClO<sub>4</sub> + 10<sup>-3</sup> M AgNO<sub>3</sub> at 0.0V (SHE). The
  result (12.21ng/Hz-cm<sup>2</sup>) agreed well with the theoretically
  calculated value (12.26ng/Hz-cm<sup>2</sup>). The holder was made of
  polychlorotrifluoroethylene to minimize the mass change due to the chemical
  reaction between the holder, silver and gases. Viton O-rings were placed on
  each side of the crystal to ensure proper sealing and to minimize the residual
  stress since the frequency can be affected by pressure as well as mass change.</p>
<p>&sect;12 The tarnish film after the exposure was analyzed on a PHI 5400 XPS system (Perkin
  Elmer Corp.) equipped with a water cooled Mg-anode (Mg-K<font face="Symbol">a</font>
  : 1253.6eV and FWHM (full width at half maximum): 0.7eV) at total power
  dissipation of 400 watts (15kV, 26.7mA). The sample stage was positioned such
  that the photoelectron emitted at an angle of 45 degrees to the plane of
  silver surface entered the analyzer through a 1 mm <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  4 mm aperture. The spectrometer was calibrated with two reference points
  (Ag-3d<sub>5/2</sub>: 368.3eV and C-1s: 284.5eV) to minimize the error due to
  the drift of the spectrometer with assumption that the shift of energy due to
  charging effects was negligible. In order to analyze the inside of the tarnish
  film, the differentially pumped argon ion gun (4kV, 2mA ions) of the XPS
  system was utilized. The calibration of the removal rate was accomplished by
  sputtering through the thickness of a Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> standard
  (1.8nm/min).</p>
<p>&sect;13 The surface morphology after exposure was observed by Field Emission
  Scanning Electron Microscopy (Model S-4500, Hitachi., Ltd.) with an
  accelerating voltage of 5kV to provide information on the tarnishing process.
  The sample stage was positioned such that the incident electron collided with
  the silver surface at an angle of 40 degrees to the plane of the surface to
  maximize the spatial resolution. The morphology could be observed with a
  maximum magnification of 100kX because of utilization of field emission as the
  electron source.</p>
<h3>&sect;14 Experimental Results</h3>
  <h4>Analysis of tarnish film with XPS</h4>
  <p>Figure 1 shows the XPS spectrum of the tarnish film formed on silver
  exposed to 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with air containing 75% R.H. for 72 hours.
  The peaks of sulfur-2p were detected at 161.8 and 161.0eV from the film
  surface indicating sulfide. No peak indicating sulfite or sulfate was detected
  before or after sputtering. The Auger parameter (724.8eV) calculated from the
  silver-3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak (B.E. = 368.2eV) and Ag-M<sub>4</sub>VV (K.E. =
  357.7eV) detected correspond to that of silver sulfide. The Auger parameter is
  shifted to that for silver metal as the intensity of sulfur-2p peak reduced
  with sputtering. The broad peak of oxygen-1s on the surface disappeared after
  sputtering. This peak is thought to result from (OH)<sub>ad</sub>, water and
  adsorbed oxygen. No oxygen-1s peak indicating the presence of oxide was
  detected before or after sputtering. Adventitious carbon also appeared on the
  surface and disappeared after sputtering. The XPS spectra of the tarnish film
  formed on silver exposed to 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with air containing 15% R.H.
  for 90 hours were similar to the above except for the sulfur-2p shown in
  Figure 2. The silver peaks and sulfur peaks identify the tarnish film as
  silver sulfide and the adsorbed species on the surface were also the same as
  the above. A small amount of sulfite (or sulfate) was detected on the surface.
  However, it was not detected after the exposure to 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with
  air containing 15% R.H. for 40 hours. Hence, the sulfite (or sulfate) may be
  produced after longer exposures than 40 hours. The XPS spectra of the tarnish
  film formed on the silver exposed to 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with nitrogen gas
  containing 75% R.H. for 72 hours were similar to the above except for the
  silver peak shown in Figure 3. The Auger parameter of silver did not match
  that of silver or silver sulfide and was positioned in the middle of these
  Auger parameters. Hence, the mismatch between the Auger parameter obtained and
  that of silver sulfide is due to the fact that the film is thinner than the
  escape depth of electrons having the kinetic energy of approximately 360eV (<font face="Symbol">�</font>
  2nm)<sup>16</sup>.</p>
<p>&sect;15 Hence, the tarnish film after exposure to environments containing H<sub>2</sub>S
  consisted of only silver sulfide covered by adventitious carbon, adsorbed
  water and possibly adsorbed oxygen and (OH)<sub>ad</sub>.</p>

<h3>&sect;19 Measurement of mass gain with QCM</h3>
  <p>Figure 4 shows the mass gain with time when silver coated crystals were
  exposed to environments containing hydrogen sulfide. The mass loss occurred
  after the exposure condition changed from 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with 75% R.H.
  air (or N<sub>2</sub>) to 15% R.H. air, indicating water desorption (120ng/cm<sup>2</sup>)
  which was 1.7 times greater than that of adsorbed water (70ng/cm<sup>2</sup>)
  on as-received silver metal. The reason that water was more adsorbed may be
  due to the difference of hydrophilicity<sup>19</sup> between silver metal
  surface and the surface covered by H<sub>2</sub>S which is soluble in water.
  The mass gain after exposure of 100ppb H2S with 75% R.H. air for 72 hours was
  two times higher than after 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with 15% R.H. air,
  indicating that adsorbed water enhanced the reaction rate. In addition, the
  mass gain in 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with 75% R.H. N<sub>2</sub> was negligible,
  indicating that the presence of oxygen is required for the sulfidation of
  silver. It agreed with the XPS result that the observed Auger parameter of
  silver was between the Auger parameter of elemental silver and that of silver
  sulfide. The curve - (a) and (b) in Fig. 4 were reploted versus time<sup>1/2</sup>
  scale instead of time scale. The mass gain in 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with 75%
  R.H. air increased linearly until 8 hours after the exposure, but its rate was
  reduced after this period, conforming to parabolic behavior. However, in
  100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with 15% R.H. air, the mass gain increased only
  parabolically without an initial linear region. In 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with
  air containing 75% R.H., the kinetic behavior is due to the change of the rate
  determining step from surface reaction or mass transport in the gas phase or
  the mixed step to mass transport through the tarnish film. The reaction
  mechanism or transport mechanism through the tarnish film will be discussed in
  the next section.</p>

<h3>&sect;22 Observation of morphology with FESEM</h3>
  <p>The surface morphologies of the tarnish films after exposure to various
  environments containing 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S were the same as the surface
  morphology of the silver coated crystal at 100k magnification. Hence, the
  tarnish film is thought to form on the silver surface uniformly.</p>
<h3>&sect;23 Phase Prediction</h3>
  <p>Fig. 6 shows the E-pH diagrams in Ag-H<sub>2</sub>O-100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S
  system obtained from the method suggested by Zappire<sup>20,21</sup>. In solid
  phase, silver metal, silver sulfide and silver sulfate were predicted as
  stable species. In liquid phase, silver ion and sulfite were predicted the
  stable species. In order to explain reaction mechanism, the concentrations of
  the silver ion and hydrogen ion were calculated using the following charge
  balance equation.</p>
  <p><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image78.gif" WIDTH="494" HEIGHT="30"> (1)</p>
<p>&sect;24 According to the XPS results that only silver sulfide was detected in
  tarnish film after the exposure of 75% R.H. environments, the concentration of
  silver ion was expressed using solubility product of silver sulfide. Each term
  was expressed as the concentration of hydrogen ion using the equilibrium
  constants listed in table 1,</p>
  <p><img src="{{ $htmURL }}image79.gif" WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="124">(2)</p>
  <p>,where P<sub>H2S</sub> and P<sub>CO2</sub> is 100ppb and 1.8ppm,
  respectively.</p>
<p>&sect;25 From equation (2), the concentration of silver ion (1.9<font face="Symbol">�</font>
  10<sup>-16</sup>) was calculated and the equilibrium potential between Ag and
  Ag<sup>+</sup> was mapped in Fig. 6. The potential where hydrogen gas is
  evolved is lower than the equilibrium potential between silver and silver ion,
  indicating that silver was not oxidized by hydrogen evolution. This calculated
  results agreed with the QCM results that silver was not oxidized without
  oxygen.</p>
<h2>&sect;26 Discussion</h2>
  <p>In 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S, silver was oxidized by oxygen, as was proved by
  the <i>in&nbsp;situ</i> measurements of mass showing that the tarnish rate of
  silver was negligible in the environments without oxygen. This corresponded to
  the results, obtained from thermodynamic calculation, that the equilibrium
  potential between Ag and Ag<sup>+</sup> being higher than that for hydrogen
  gas evolution as shown in Fig. 6-(b). In addition to oxygen, the amount of
  adsorbed water affected the tarnish rate. This effect was explained by the
  change of ionic path on surface<sup>8</sup> or the change of activity of other
  gas<sup>9</sup>. It could also be explained by the change of properties of
  adsorbed water with humidity<sup>6, 10</sup>. The formation of a few
  monolayers makes the behavior of adsorbed water be that of the bulk water. In
  the humid environments used in this tests (75% R.H.), the water was adsorbed
  as much as 2.5 monolayers. Furthermore, the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S
  increased the amount of water from 2.5 monolayers to 5.3 monolayers. Hence,
  the tarnish process in humid environments is supposed to be regarded as the
  reaction in aqueous solution. The following reactions in humid environments
  are suggested:</p>
  <p>Anodic reaction: <img src="{{ $htmURL }}image80.gif" WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="30"> <font face="Symbol">f</font> <sub>Ag/Ag+</sub>

      <p>where <font face="Symbol">f</font> <sub>Ag/Ag+</sub> is calculated from
      [Ag<sup>+</sup>] <font face="Symbol">�</font> 10<sup>-16</sup> and the
      activity of water = 1.</p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
<p>&sect;27 In addition, the detection of linear region in humid environment in Fig. 5
  could be also explained by the high oxidizing power in humid environment and
  the high electrical conductivity of silver sulfide film region (<i>i.e., <font face="Symbol">k</font></i><sub>Ag2O</sub>
  <font face="Symbol">�</font> 10<sup>-8</sup><font face="Symbol">W</font> <sup>-1</sup>-cm<sup>-1</sup>,
  <font face="Symbol">k</font> <sub>Ag2S</sub> <font face="Symbol">�</font> 10<sup>-8</sup>
  <font face="Symbol">W</font> <sup>-1</sup>-cm<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>11, 12</sup>.
  In 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S with air containing 15% R.H., the amount of adsorbed
  water was 14ng/cm<sup>2</sup> (<font face="Symbol">�</font> 0.5 monolayer),
  whose physical properties are different from that of bulk water. Unlike the
  humid environment, the tarnish process in dry environments is supposed to be
  regarded as the reaction between metal and gases. Compared to dry environment,
  the dissolved oxygen in humid environments increased the oxidizing rate of
  silver, and sequentially enhanced tarnish rate. The presence of sulfur with
  high chemical state detected on tarnish film after longer than 40 hour
  exposure in low humidified (15% R.H.) air containing 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S
  could be explained by low diffusion rate of silver. Low oxidizing power in dry
  environment and the growth of the film reduce the flux of silver, making
  sulfide have more chance to react with oxygen, to form stable phase such as
  sulfur with high chemical state.</p>
<p>&sect;28 In addition, the detection of linear region in humid environment in Fig. 5
  could be also explained by the high oxidizing power in humid environment and
  the high electrical conductivity of silver sulfide film region (<i>i.e., <font face="Symbol">k</font>
  </i><sub>Ag2O</sub> <font face="Symbol">�</font> 10<sup>-8</sup> <font face="Symbol">W</font>
  <sup>-1</sup>-cm<sup>-1</sup>, <font face="Symbol">k</font> <sub>Ag2S</sub> <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  10<sup>-8</sup> <font face="Symbol">W</font> <sup>-1</sup>-cm<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>11,
  12</sup>. Low electrical conductivity of tarnish film could not provide the
  detection of linear though the oxidizing power was enhanced.</p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>&sect;29 The aim of this investigation was the study of the effects of relative
  humidity and oxygen on the tarnish process of silver in various environments
  containing 100ppb H<sub>2</sub>S. The mass change was monitored during
  exposure and the tarnish film was analyzed by XPS. From the experimental
  results, the conclusions are as follows:</p>
<p>&sect;30 Tarnish film formed consisted of only silver sulfide covered by
  adventitious carbon, adsorbed water and possibly adsorbed oxygen and (OH)<sub>ad</sub>.</p>
<p>&sect;31 Silver was not tarnished without oxygen, which proved by QCM results and
  thermodynamic calculation.</p>
<p>&sect;32 The amount of adsorbed water in 75% R.H. environment was as much as 2.5
  monolayers and the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S increased the amount of adsorbed
  water to 5.3 monolayers. It is enough to act as bulk water. Hence, the high
  tarnish rate in humid environment is due to the presence of bulk water layer
  in which oxygen is dissolved to oxidize silver.</p>
<p>&sect;33 In humid environment, the kinetic behavior was due to the high electrical
  conductivity of the tarnish film and the high oxidizing power due to adsorbed
  water.</p>
