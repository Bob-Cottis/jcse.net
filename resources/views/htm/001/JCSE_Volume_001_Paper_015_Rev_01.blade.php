  <h2>Scientific Engineering of Anti-Corrosion Coating Systems based on Organic
  Metals (Polyaniline)</h2>

  subsidiary of Zipperling Kessler &amp; Co.)</p>
  <h3>&sect;1 <b>Abstract</b></h3>
  <p>The new corrosion protection technology with polyaniline, an Organic Metal
  (conductive polymer), is presented. It is based on an immense surface
  ennobling and the formation of a passivating metal oxide. The requirements for
  efficiently working coating systems, comprising the dispersed Organic Metal
  containing primer, eventually an intercoat, and a top coat, are characterized.
  An integrated 4-step-method (&quot;scientific engineering&quot;) has been
  developed and is successfully used for the systematic development of such
  coating systems. The combination of the measurement of the open circuit
  potential, a new scratch test, EIS and SKP together are a powerful tool for
  predicting the results of accelerated corrosion tests and real-time corrosion
  prevention performance. Organic Metal coating systems are out-performing even
  the best conventional anti-corrosion coating systems.</p>

<h3>&sect;3 1. Early work</h3>
  <p>We began our research in this area 1986 and prepared the first dispersed
  polyaniline (PAni) containing coating in 1987 <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>.
  Our goal was to find out, if corrosion protection was possible on just normal
  steel, without any pretreatment, especially without previous passivation in
  acid or under electrochemical conditions. We wanted to know, if corrosion
  protection was feasible using a PAni dispersion in a coating, hence without
  any electrochemical deposition of PAni. Our research was motivated by the
  publication of deBerry in 1985 <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
  according to which polyaniline, electrochemically deposited on pre-passivated
  stainless steel in strong acid environment, was enhancing the corrosion
  protection of this metal. Similar observations, however with a composition not
  identical with polyaniline, had previously been made by Mengoli et al <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>.
  Both authors favoured the conclusion, that PAni, if electrodeposited on pre-passivated
  steel, was capable of maintaining the passive state.</p>
<p>&sect;4 This was the only public knowledge available, when we first began our work
  with the goal to find out about anti-corrosion effects based on PAni. Our
  proprietary knowledge at that time was how to disperse polyaniline, although
  still at a relatively low performance level, as we had succeeded with first
  dispersions of polyaniline only some 2, 3 years before (mainly in
  thermoplastic polymers). It was completely unknown, if a PAni dispersion
  coating (with the PAni-free insulating matrix around) would have any effect,
  and if, what the effect would be based on, and if not, how to make it to be an
  anti-corrosion coating. Nothing at all was known about any anti-corrosion
  effect of PAni, if applied non-electrochemically and on a non pre-passivated
  steel (or iron or any other metal) surface, and nothing at all was to be
  expected in this direction at that time.</p>
<p>&sect;5 In 1987, we surprisingly found some corrosion protection <a href="#_edn1">[1]</a>,
  and we also found that an oxide was formed, but this could have been any oxide
  or hydroxide, or even a first sign of rust, as we had not yet been able to see
  any improvement over state-of-the-art coatings. We followed these first
  findings in the next years, partially together with other groups, and also
  published another patent application <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>
  with some improvements in corrosion protection, but still not at all
  convincing for corrosion experts, still not performing reproducibly, and not
  performing any better than conventional coatings, but worse.</p>
<p>&sect;6 At that time, we had no idea, what mechanism was active if there was any
  beneficial and remarkable anti-corrosion effect of polyaniline deposited by
  other than electrochemical means on other than pre-passivated metal surfaces
  (stainless steel) under other than passivating conditions. The conductive
  polymer research community, and moreover the corrosion experts outside it, did
  not believe in the possibility to realize an anti-corrosion technique using
  polyaniline, especially not with a PAni dispersion. Also Allied and Americhem,
  with which together we had made the study leading to the second patent <a href="#_edn4">[4]</a>,
  stopped their work on this question and left the cooperation, as a success of
  the research was not at hand.</p>
<h3>&sect;7 2. Breakthrough</h3>
  <p>It was in 1993 that we found out how to reproducibly realize superior
  corrosion protection with Organic Metals. We discovered the phenomena
  responsible for the new corrosion protection principle: it was a surface
  ennobling (i.e., a shift of the corrosion potential of the metal surface by
  about 800 mV to the more noble range) and a new type of passivation (i.e., the
  formation of a stoichiometric iron (II) oxide) <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>.
  For the basic studies, we used as well pure polyaniline dispersions as
  polyaniline dispersion coatings which were deposited on untreated metals like
  normal iron, stainless steel, copper and aluminum.</p>
<p>&sect;8 The corrosion current was significantly reduced or even completely
  eliminated at comparable potentials (Fig. 1). Investigations with SEM revealed
  that an oxide layer was formed between the PAni coating and the metal surface.
  In cooperation with R. Elsenbaumer, we found that it is mainly composed by Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  (with an underlayer of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>.
  We repeated the study with a cleaner steel surface to begin with by XPS in
  cooperation with a group at Kiel <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>
  (Fig. 2) showing that there was no Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, but only a
  clean <font face="Symbol">a</font>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. (This does not
  exclude, that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> might also occur in real situations,
  but it shows that <font face="Symbol">a</font>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is
  the passivating layer composition formed by PAni, which has also independently
  been confirmed by R. Elsenbaumer <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a> and
  T. Schauer et al. <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>, although there is
  some dispute if it is the <font face="Symbol">a</font>- or the <font face="Symbol">g</font>-
  form which is formed).</p>
<p>&sect;9 It is of basic interest that an oxide like that has - to our knowledge -
  never been observed or analysed for the &quot;passive&quot; state of stainless
  steel (or simple steel), which is not a stable property (after removing the
  steel from the passivating medium, its passivity is completely lost). In
  contrast, A.-M. LeGoff et al. have published, that the nature of the passive
  layer is FeOOH <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>. This means, that
  our new technology is also the first one which allows to produce Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  as a passivating oxide layer. <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>&sect;10 In the meantime, in research together with G. Nimtz <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>
  et al. using microwave, and in work together with A. Kaiser et al. <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>
  using thermopower measurements, we had discovered that polyaniline not only is
  a conductive polymer, but a true, though &quot;mesoscopic&quot; metal, and
  hence can be considered as an &quot;Organic Metal&quot;. Now we understood
  that the ennobling was possible due to its metallic property, as it is
  situated slightly less noble than silver in the galvanic serie <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;11 Our group later succeeded in improving the dispersed PAni containing paints
  and coating systems (primer + top coat) <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>
  which are capable of inducing the same passivation effect, but are moreover
  industrially applicable and effective as corrosion prevention coating systems.
  They perform significantly better than anti-corrosion coating systems composed
  by zinc rich epoxy primers and epoxy top coats <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;12 We also discovered the reaction sequence which is responsible for the
  passivation (oxide layer formation) and the corrosion protection induced by
  the PAni layer. Fig. 3 shows an improved version of the reaction scheme
  elaborated by us <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>. It involves
  Fe-oxidation by PAni (the more noble metal, Emeraldine salt ES), which is
  thereby reduced to Leucoemeraldine base (LE) <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>;
  further oxidation of Fe (II) to Fe (III) and reoxidation of LE to PAni (ES)
  via the Emeraldine base EB occur both by oxygen; and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  deposition by resulting OH<sup>-</sup>. This scheme shows furthermore, that
  our Organic Metal acts as a catalyst, and that the full catalytic cycle (ES <font face="Symbol">�</font>
  LE <font face="Symbol">�</font> EB and back to ES) will only take place, if
  the necessary H<sup>+</sup> will not be removed by the surrounding medium,
  i.e. only, if the acidic pH will be maintained within the primer, e.g. due to
  the barrier property of the top coat.</p>
<p>&sect;13 It should be noted, that this new ennobling and passivation technology is
  only feasible with well advanced Organic Metal (PAni) dispersions in specially
  composed coatings. The particle size of PAni in our dispersions is about 70
  nm. At such small particle size level, the dispersed Organic Metal phase will
  form the necessary network flocculation structures at very low concentrations <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[</a><a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">19]</a>
  (we are using only about 2% PAni in our liquid coatings).</p>
<p>&sect;14 Other PAni formulations like &quot;soluble polyaniline&quot; <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[</a><a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">20]</a>
  do not offer any corrosion prevention effect. It is important to know, that
  the sample (3) mentioned in Section 4 and Table 4 in [20] is our Pani
  dispersion (in other publications P. Kinlen referred to it as &quot;PAni/thermoplastic&quot;),
  was transferred by us to Monsanto for their comparison tests. It performed
  comparably well as a zinc-rich primer with an epoxy topcoat <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[</a><a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">21]</a>.
  The samples &quot;PAni/Phenoxy&quot; and &quot;PAni/Acrylic&quot; are PANDA
  products, which do not show any interesting anti-corrosion effect <a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a>.
  We hypothesize, that this is due to the special structure of PANDA, which is
  called a &quot;solution&quot;, but is in fact a fine dispersion with a (mainly
  insulating) dispersion stabilization layer adsorbed on the particle surface <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;15 Other approaches like neutral PAni dispersions in NMP (wrongly been
  assigned as &quot;solutions&quot;) to be doped after application on the metal <a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a>
  are not only not effective, but also not practical <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;16 N-PAni (the Emeraldine base, &quot;undoped&quot;) is also contributing some
  anti-corrosion effect, but by a factor of 100 to 1000 smaller [6]; this effect
  is probably due to its amine groups and could therefore be attributed to a
  pure inhibition mechanism.</p>
<p>&sect;17 It seems that the new effects of ennobling and passivation found by us are
  linked with well structured ultrafine dispersions (50 - 100 nm) of the Organic
  Metal in suitable matrices, forming a conductive and catalytically reactive
  continuous (and conductive!) network of flocculated PAni particles.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a></p>
<h3>&sect;18 3. The need for a systematic, scientific development tool</h3>
  <p>When we started our primer and coating system development, we were aware of
  the fact, that we had no practical experience in corrosion phenomena, and even
  less in coatings. On the other hand, corrosion and coatings experts did not
  believe in our findings, and we were unable to convince them to combine their
  experience in coatings with ours in the Organic Metal polyaniline, its
  synthesis and dispersion, and in &quot;ennobling and passivation&quot; by it.</p>
<p>&sect;19 We realized very soon [<a href="#_edn5">5</a>c, <a href="#_edn15">15</a>],
  that a polyaniline containing primer alone was not sufficient as a practically
  convincing coating system, but that it needed a top coat. This top coat (or
  eventually an intercoat between primer and final top coat) had to fulfill
  certain requirements in order to be compatible with the primer. The primer
  itself had to meet the following demands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>good adherence to the metal substrate (in dry stage, as well during the
      corrosion attack / dry and wet adhesion)</li>
    <li>good overcoating ability</li>
    <li>practical application demands (viscosity, drying time, ...)</li>
    <li>and most important: the full metallic (ennobling) and catalytic
      (passivating) properties.</li>
  </ul>
<p>&sect;20 The top coat (or the intercoat, resp.) had to offer</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a good (chemical and physical) compatiblity with the primer <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></li>
    <li>sufficient &quot;sealing&quot; properties (which we first decided not to
      offer with the primer itself, but only by the top coat, or by primer + top
      coat system together) <a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a></li>
    <li>all necessary weatherability and other surface properties needed (colour,
      gloss, mechanical or chemical and UV resistance, ...).</li>
  </ul>
<p>&sect;21 Having no practical experience and not enough time for the development of
  such coating systems, which should not only to be competitive, but moreover
  out-performing generally used state-of-the-art products, we had no other
  chance than to follow a scientific systematic route, in contrast to a
  &quot;trial-and-error&quot; strategy.</p>
<p>&sect;22 We started with the open circuit potential (and corrosion current density)
  measurement as described in <a href="#_edn5">[5b]</a> in combination with a
  wheel-driven alternating immersion test according to DIN 50905 T4 as a 2-step
  screening tool. Systems which passed our test <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a>
  were subjected to other laboratory tests, salt spray and outside weathering
  corrosion tests (cf. [16]). We found an acceptable correlation in performance
  and decided to let one of our systems be tested by a neutral paint research
  institute, the &quot;Forschungsinstitut f�r Pigmente und Lacke&quot; in
  Stuttgart.</p>
<p>&sect;23 Two studies were performed by them on our behalf. The first study was a
  comparison between a system composed of our primer 900 226/32 plus our
  selected epoxy top coat (&quot;2-C EP&quot;) and 2 comparative systems having
  the same primer, but different top coats (&quot;2-C AY&quot; and &quot;1-C
  AY&quot;, resp.). The study comprised measurement of dry and wet adhesion, and
  salt spray test performance. The system /32 + &quot;2-C EP&quot; performed by
  far at best <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a>, and the performance
  was in accordance with our previous internal results and <a href="#_edn16">[16]</a>.
  This system is a first model system for our first commercial product (CORRPASSIV<sup>TM</sup>
  4900), introduced in late 1996 <a href="#_edn15">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;24 The second study involved a system we had developed for aluminum, which
  requires a different primer used with the same &quot;2-C EP&quot; top coat.
  Here, the filiform corrosion was tested, both in laboratory as in an outside
  weathering site at Netherlands. Also this system performed very well, as
  documented by FPL <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a>. This system has
  been further developed by us to a commercial product.</p>
<p>&sect;25 In parallel, the FPL investigated some other properties <a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a>
  of some systems comparable to those evaluated in the first study. They
  confirmed the immense potential shift found by us earlier <a href="#_edn5">[5]</a>
  and found comparable potential values. The formation of the iron oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  was confirmed, too. They also confirmed a link between barrier properties,
  stability of potential shift and corrosion protection performance.</p>
<p>&sect;26 However, for further development of more and different systems for
  different corrosion environments, we needed a tool which was not only capable
  of screening between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but was moreover
  capable of delivering quantitative data enabling us to predict corrosion test
  results, both of accelerated and real-time tests and practical behaviour.</p>
<h3>&sect;27 4. &quot;Scientific Engineering&quot;: a new research and development tool
  for anti-corrosion coatings</h3>
  <p>This was the reason why we continued to study and develop other techniques <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a>
  for evaluating those properties which we consider being the key requirements
  for good corrosion protection performance with Organic Metal coatings,</p>
  <ol>
    <li>the ennobling (i.e., the potential shift)</li>
    <li>the passivation (i.e., the oxide layer formation)</li>
    <li>adhesion of primer (+ top coat) also under corrosive conditions, and
      resistance against underfilm corrosion (i.e., minimum underfilm corrosion
      propagation velocity)</li>
    <li>optimal barrier properties to be maintained as long as possible under
      corrosive conditions.</li>
  </ol>
<p>&sect;28 These 4 properties are now measured by us with the following methods:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>open circuit potential measurement</li>
    <li>a scratch test developed by us</li>
    <li>Scanning Kelvin potential measurement (SKP)</li>
    <li>electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), using a new routine FFT
      technique.</li>
  </ol>
<p>&sect;29 Test 1 and 2 are used as a first screening. Test 3 and 4 are used for
  advanced screening, before they are combined with an immersion cycling,
  cycling climate test or salt spray test for those systems which pass the
  advanced screening successfully.</p>
<p>&sect;30 Industrially useful coating systems have been developed by us following
  this &quot;Scientific Engineering Method&quot;. The results reported below
  were found on test panels coated with PAni containing primer <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a>
  applied with a thickness of 20 �m and coated with various top coats.</p>
<h4>&sect;31 4.1 Open Circuit Potential Measurement</h4>
  <p>This routine measurement can be performed under various well-known
  conditions [<a href="#_edn5">5b</a>, <a href="#_edn6">6</a>, <a href="#_edn8">8</a>,
  <a href="#_edn32">32</a>] and does not need to be described further. Schauer
  et al. <a href="#_edn32">[32]</a> have confirmed the range of the high
  potential shift found by us earlier <a href="#_edn5">[5]</a>. Our internal
  specification is a potential shift to at least +100mV and a long term
  stability of it.</p>
<h4>&sect;32 4.2 Scratch Test</h4>
  <p>This test can be performed in two ways, (a) by coating half of a panel with
  Pani containing primer, the other half with a conventional epoxy primer, then
  applying a top coat (e.g. 2-C EP) on both primers, or (b) by coating a panel
  completely with the coating system to be tested.</p>
<p>&sect;33 The coating is then injured with scratches 1 mm wide and 50 mm long, down
  to the metal. The panels are immersed in 10% salt containing water. After 1
  night and after 100 and 300 hours, the panels are checked with respect to rust
  formation in the scratch: only those systems will be accepted to become
  commercial products, where <u>no rust will be formed within the open scratch
  during this time</u> (see Fig. 4). Conventional systems, also the very good
  ones, will develop rust in the open scratch, because the area there is not
  protected. They also develop rust under the coating, propagating at various
  velocities (cf. 4.3).</p>
<p>&sect;34 The protection provided by the polyaniline dispersion coating, the
  ennobling, however is a far-reaching effect because of its metallic nature. We
  are assuming furthermore, that it is not only the ennobling which provides
  protection for open scratches of this size, but also the passivation by Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  formation: this oxide can be found up to about 400 �m away from the coating
  edge as seen by XPS <a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;35 This protection can be effective more than 1 mm away from a coating edge,
  which makes anti-corrosion systems based on our Organic Metal a powerful edge
  corrosion protection technology. We even have sometimes found much bigger
  areas being protected even after removal of the coatings <a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a>.</p>
<h4>&sect;36 4.3 Scanning Volta Potential Measurements (Kelvin Probe)</h4>
  <p>The Volta potential measured with a Kelvin sensor is suitable for
  non-contact measurements of surface potentials even under undamaged surface
  coatings <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a>, <a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a>.
  The function principle and experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 5. The
  measurement object, the working electrode, and the reference electrode of the
  Kelvin probe form, due to the small gap between them, a capacitor. Between
  them a potential is developed, the amplitude of which gives a measure of the
  chemical nature of the material on the surface of the metal. A periodic
  variation in separation by means of an actuator built into the sensor changes
  the capacitance of the set-up. The resulting signal is converted to a
  measurement signal by means of a lock-in amplifier <a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;37 The resulting data is a scan of the surface Volta potential of the metal
  under the coating, which can - under certain conditions - be related with the
  corrosion potential. But for the purpose we are looking for, this is not a
  necessary relation <a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a>. In this part
  of our method, we only need to know the differences of potentials (a) between
  various sites, i.e. between the open scratch and the not injured areas of the
  coating (b) with the change in immersion time.</p>
<p>&sect;38 With this technique, we monitor and predict adhesion (or delamination) of
  the coating under corrosive attack. The underfilm corrosion propagation
  velocity (more precise: the corrosion potential propagation velocity, due to
  the first delamination of the coating before even first corrosion occurs) can
  be quantitatively measured.</p>
<p>&sect;39 In contrast to the sample design by Stratmann <a href="#_edn38">[38]</a>,
  we are measuring on samples like those used in our scratch test (4.2.). This
  leads to the phenomenon, that in the best of our systems, no potential
  negative enough for even to start any corrosion develops, so that no
  delamination or even rust formation or underrusting can occur.</p>
<p>&sect;40 Fig. 6 is showing a development of the Volta potentials in the open scratch
  and in the neighbourhood under the coating with time (polyaniline dispersion
  primer plus top coat). We are interested to follow the potential change
  especially in the first 24 hours of immersion in salt water (after usual
  conditioning in humid atmosphere). Typically, in the best system, a
  &quot;W&quot; form of the potential distribution forms, with no potential
  approaching strong enough negative values (Fig. 7), to allow corrosion. Only,
  when the bottom of the &quot;W&quot; form reaches values of -200mV or lower, a
  delamination (the prerequisite for corrosion) can be observed and corrosion
  may start. The delamination velocity is estimated with widening of the
  negative corrosion potential &quot;W&quot; valley, if it occurs at all (Fig.
  8).</p>
<p>&sect;41 In contrast, scratches in coatings without Organic Metal primer have a big
  potential difference, a broad and deep valley, resulting in a high
  underrusting propagation velocity (Table 1). Very quickly, in the middle of
  the scratch the potential is strongly increasing now as the sign of rust
  formation.</p>
<p>&sect;42 We differentiate various polyaniline dispersion coating systems under
  development by comparison with the actually best performing benchmark, where
  no corrosion potential is reached in the scratch, hence no delamination
  occurs.</p>
<p>&sect;43 Three systems, each built up on the same primer, but top coated with
  different paints (Table 1), have all passed the scratch test but were
  different in their OCP. The question to be evaluated was: Do we see a
  difference in the delamination velocity? Table 1 contains the answer
  &quot;Yes&quot;: after 24 hours, significant differences can be noticed. Note,
  that the performance order is in parallel with all other results. Primer
  formulations (same basis) without polyaniline under even the best top coats
  have 5-10 times quicker delamination. The best top coat on polyaniline
  dispersion primer alone (on epoxy primer or even on Zn-rich epoxy primer) does
  not perform comparably well at all. It is the most important conclusion, that
  underrusting or persistent passivation, resp., is also strongly influenced by
  the top coat, a conclusion which is not at all self-explanatory, but can be
  understood in view of [<a href="#_edn17">17</a>, <a href="#_edn7">7</a>] and
  Fig. 1.</p>
<p>&sect;44 We set our internal specification as an underfilm corrosion propagation
  velocity of between 3 and 5 �m/h or less. Epoxy coating systems (primer plus
  top coat) are generally showing a velocity of around 20 to 60 �m/h, a factor
  of 10 or more faster than polyaniline dispersion coating systems.</p>
<p>&sect;45 Zn-rich epoxy primers (with epoxy top coat) do even show much quicker
  underfilm propagation, at least in the first 1-2 days. Such systems are not
  scratch-tolerant, they perform very well only with intact coatings. In
  comparison to that, our systems based on Organic Metals are performing
  extremely well both with and without scratches.</p>
<p>&sect;46 Only the best cataphoretic coatings on Zn-Phospate electrochemically
  pretreated steel in car manufacturing are showing figures (3-5 �m/h)
  comparable with polyaniline dispersion coating (0 - 5 �m/h). We are convinced
  to be able to achieve these numbers also with future product developments (as
  we actually see with some developmental products).</p>
<h4>&sect;47 4.4 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</h4>
  <p>The technique is used by us to predict the performance of the complete
  primer / top coat (or eventually including an intercoat) system. We developed
  this technique as a routine method together with G. Popkirov based on his new
  FFT-EIS technique <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a>. Measurements
  are carried out with a three-electrode system using a cell as described in <a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a>.
  The experimental set-up for this Fast Fourier Transformation Electrochemical
  Impedance Spectrometer is given in Fig. 9. A frequency-rich perturbation
  signal with a small amplitude is applied to the electrochemical cell
  controlled by an EG&amp;G Princeton Research potentiostat Model 263A. In the
  present investigation a computer programmed sum of 42 sine waves distributed
  over 4 decades was used to synthesize the perturbation signal of a home-built
  signal generator The peak-to-peak amplitude of the perturbation voltage was
  usually 150 mV. The perturbation and the response signal are amplified and
  filtered by a Stanford Research Systems Inc. Model SR 640 Dual Channel
  Low-Pass filter. A/D and D/A conversion, timing and controlling were carried
  out by a 16-bit, 100 kHz transient recorder PC-card from United Electronic
  Industries, Inc. Model Win- 30/3016. Impedance spectra were evaluated by fast
  Fourier transformation of the perturbation and the response signal (Fig. 10).</p>
<p>&sect;48 For the experiments describing our procedure and representative examples,
  the following lacquer systems were used on polyaniline dispersion primer:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>two-component epoxy top coat - amine hardened = 2-C EP</li>
    <li>two-component acrylic top coat = 2-C AY</li>
    <li>one-component acrylic top coat = 1-C AY</li>
  </ol>
<p>&sect;49 The tests were made on sand blasted panels from Mercedes Benz and are from
  the same serie with those evaluated in 4.5 (cf. <a href="#_edn30">[30]</a>).</p>
<p>&sect;50 Fig. 11a-c show experimental EIS data for the three different top coated
  steel panels as a function of immersion time. The measurements were carried
  out in 10% NaCl. Changes in the impedance spectra were observed over a six day
  period except for the 1-C acrylic top coat with a one day period.</p>
<p>&sect;51 The recording of the spectra takes about 5 - 20 seconds, the Nyquist and
  Bode plots are available for interpretation after another 15 seconds. The
  bottleneck for measuring more samples is only the number of available
  immersion cells, as they are placed and immersed in the same cell as they are
  measured. But as we are not measuring all of the systems under development,
  but only those which have passed the first screening, this is not a
  practically important limitation.</p>
<p>&sect;52 The performance of the complete system under evaluation can be assessed
  after 1 or 2 weeks at most. If their impedance spectra do not change
  significantly during this time (as shown by sample 1, which is a commercial
  polyaniline dispersion coating), we can expect a very good long-term corrosion
  protection performance.</p>
<p>&sect;53 Systems, which will fail, are loosing their capacitance during 1 week or
  even quicker. It can be seen, that the stability of the EIS spectra or loss of
  the pure capacitance behaviour is parallel to the results found in 4.5, a good
  or bad performance in VDA cycling test.</p>
<p>&sect;54 It should again be noted, that systems (samples #5 and #6) composed by a
  pure epoxy primer or a Zn-rich epoxy primer top coated with the same EP top
  coat as in the polyaniline dispersion coating /2-C EP (sample #1) again perfom
  worse (i.e., they loose impedance very quickly, Fig. 12).</p>
<h4>&sect;55 Intermediate conclusion</h4>
  <p>Scratch test, OCP, RKS and EIS are probing each different aspects of the
  integral named &quot;corrosion protection performance&quot;. Ennobling and
  passivation, primer adhesion (delamination/underrusting) or coating barrier
  properties, being tested somewhat in a separated manner, belong and work
  together. Both underrusting (delamination) and barrier property (impedance)
  are not only dependant on the primer <u>or</u> the topcoat, but the
  combination of both.</p>
<h4>&sect;56 4.5 Climate cycling test (VDA) / Salt Spray Test</h4>
  <p>This test is used by us only after successful basic and advanced screening
  (4.1 to 4.4).</p>
<p>&sect;57 The systems described above (scratched panels) have been subjected to these
  accelerated corrosion tests for comparison of these test results with our
  4-step method (cf. <a href="#_edn30">[30]</a>). Underfilm corrosion,
  blistering and degree of rusting are summarised in Table 1. In this test, as
  in real life, both the performance of the intact coating on the metal itself,
  as also the injured (scratch) coating behaviour plays a role. These effects
  have been tested in the 4 tests shown above, and they are working together in
  accelerated corrosion tests and in outside weathering or other real corrosion
  environments.</p>
<p>&sect;58 The tests showed that all three coating systems provide highly efficient
  corrosion protection and complete suppression of underfilm corrosion over a
  period of more than 1000 h; especially with top coat 2-C EP no change at all
  was found even after 1000 h. The other top coats allow some blistering. None
  of the systems are really failing, but they are slightly different in their
  overall acceptable performance.</p>
<p>&sect;59 Our 4-step &quot;Scientific Engineering&quot; test method is able to
  differentiate much quicker and much more sensitively than do these generally
  accepted accelerated corrosion tests.</p>
<h3>&sect;60 5. Conclusions and Outlook</h3>
  <p>The new Organic Metal polyaniline, almost a noble metal, ennobles steel and
  other metal surfaces while shifting their surface potential. It furthermore
  passivates the conventional metals by forming a metal oxide layer of up to 1
  �m thickness. This exciting new technology is based on extremely fine
  dispersions of PAni in coating matrices of special composition.</p>
<p>&sect;61 Many internal and independant tests [<a href="#_edn4">4</a>, <a href="#_edn8">8</a>,
  <a href="#_edn20">20</a>, <a href="#_edn24">24</a>] have shown that the
  presence of polyaniline at the metal surface (to be protected) alone in
  regardless what chemistry form or matrix is by far not sufficient for a
  reproducible and practically convincing high-performance corrosion protection
  coating.</p>
<p>&sect;62 As shown, the systematic combination of 4 tests, the measurement of the
  corrosion potential shift, a new simple scratch test, the Volta potential
  measurement with the Scanning Kelvin probe, and electrochemical impedance
  spectroscopy, eventually to be combined with salt spray or climate cycling
  test according to VDA (Association of German Automobilists) is a productive
  tool for testing and improving corrosion protection coating systems. In
  contrast to salt spray and climate cycling tests (3-6 months), useful results
  from measurements with EIS and the SKP can be obtained within 1-2 weeks (after
  complete drying of the coatings to be tested), from where accelerated
  corrosion test results and real-world corrosion prevention performance can be
  predicted.</p>
<p>&sect;63 Polyaniline dispersion coating coating systems for various industrial
  applications have been developed with this method <a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a>.
  They were specified and are released by several customers; practical
  industrial reference objects have been realized, e.g. pipelines, bridges,
  boats, container ships, steel constructions in chemical plants, hydraulic
  construction in waste water management, hydraulic service center in Airbus
  manufacturing etc. <a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</a>. They are
  performing much better than any other conventional anti-corrosion coating.
  They can be applied at a 25 to 60% reduced coating thickness compared to
  conventional systems, without any loss of performance <a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45">[45]</a>.</p>
<p>&sect;64 Recently, new systems have been developed with the help of these
  techniques, namely</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a system for coil coating (4500), which is now under first technical
      tests; this product is designed to replace chromates in coil coating;</li>
    <li>a completely new water-born system comprising a water-born primer and a
      water-born, or a 100% solids, resp., top-coat; this system will perform at
      least as well as generally available well performing solvent-borne
      coatings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both systems will soon be presented for independent performance tests.</p>
<p>&sect;65 It might also be of interest, that our polyaniline dispersion coating
  systems have shown a well advanced performance on structural light metal
  alloys, like Mg alloys for automotive use. We are following this area, too,
  whereby we still need to develop our &quot;Scientific Engineering&quot; method
  for these metal substrates. Another system for structural Al applications
  (aerospace) is under development. Here again, the replacement of chromates is
  the environmentally important goal of the project.</p>
<p>&sect;66 Considering the short time we had for the development, our systematic
  4-step method has helped us to develop coating systems of the highest
  performance at significantly lower coating thickness, because it led to a deep
  understanding of the phenomena during corrosion attack, ennobling and
  passivation. We were able to show, that</p>
  <ul>
    <li>our Organic Metal allows for a powerful anti-corrosion technology, and</li>
    <li>the development of corrosion prevention coatings must not necessarily be
      based only on long-term practical studies with a
      &quot;trial-and-error-&quot;strategy, but can also be based on systematic
      scientific tests allowing to gather reliable results within a few weeks
      only.</li>
  </ul>
<p>&sect;67 It would certainly be of interest to find out, if this method can also be
  applied on general, non-PAni-coating systems, to predict their performance.</p>
<p>&sect;68 Both, the Organic Metal anti-corrosion technology and our Scientific
  Engineering of anti-corrosion coating systems, have the potential to
  revolutionize corrosion protection. Not only new systems can be quickly
  developed with a high correlation between short term measurement and long-term
  performance, but also coatings with about 5 times longer lifetime for the
  metals to be protected, at 25 - 60% lower coating thickness, replacing
  chromates and zinc can be provided.</p>
<p>&sect;69 Considering the fact, that corrosion is responsible for the loss of about
  4% of each countries Gross National Product per year, and considering, that
  the repair of the lost values not only requires financial, but even more
  environmental resources, our new technology could significantly contribute to
  reduce costs and to a future ecologically acceptable economy
  (&quot;sustainable economy&quot;).</p>
