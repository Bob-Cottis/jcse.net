  <p align="left">A tendency of new cast austenitic-ferritic steels to stress  
  corrosion cracking have been investigated in different aggressive environments  
  to determine the regions of their most efficient application. It has been  
  established that investigated austenitic-ferritic steels are the promising  
  corrosion resistant materials to be used in hot concentrated alkaline  
  solutions, in cold and hot tap water, and low concentrated chloride solutions.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT>  <h4 align="left">1 Introduction</h4>       
  <p align="left">Conventional corrosion-resistant steels - deformed and, in        
  particular, cast - are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in many        
  processing and natural environments, sensitive to intergranular corrosion in        
  sensitizing, and in certain cases to pitting and crevice corrosion.</p>       
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">Scientists have paid special attention during the last decade        
  to determining the regions of efficient application of ferritic and        
  austenitic-ferritic corrosion-resistant steels instead of conventional        
  corrosion resistant chrome-nickel and chrome-nickel-molybdenum austenitic and        
  other steels [1-6].</p>       
<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">A number of publications concerned with the        
  austenitic-ferritic corrosion resistant steels are many time smaller than that        
  dealing with the austenitic steels, and there are almost no data on the        
  corrosion resistance and corrosion-mechanical strength of the cast steels.</p>       
<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">According to the corrosion behaviour of the        
  austenitic-ferritic steels, they may represent promising materials for        
  production of cast components designed for service in corrosive chloride and        
  alkaline environments.</p>

  frequently for steel testing in power engineering which requires the         
  simulating of operating conditions for these materials, used in power plant.         
  The surface of individual elements of power plant may be characterized by the         
  concentration of chlorides or alkali (or both) during evaporation of boiler or         
  reactor water, steam condensation, variations of the composition of the heat         
  carrier in dead zone or below deposits on heat-transferring surfaces, and         
  under other conditions causing the increase of the concentrations of these         
  corrosive compounds.</p>        
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">The susceptibility to SCC was estimated on the basis of         
  threshold stress under static tensile loading for 1440 hours and more; on the         
  basis of the conventional stress corrosion cracking threshold Kscc (the level         
  of the stress intensity factor below which cracks do not grow in the         
  aggressive environment). We determined conventional Kscc because in the given         
  specimen types plane strain does not take place. SCC tests were also conducted         
  at a low strain rate of 2x10<sup>-6.</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> to determine the         
  variation of the ductility characteristics and the time to failure of the         
  specimens in a corrosive environment relatively to inert environment [7]. In         
  the first case we used standard specimens with a diameter of 5 mm, in the         
  second case - beam specimens with a cross section of 20x10 mm with an induced         
  fatigue crack whose depth, together with the depth of the mechanical notch,         
  was 4.5 mm, whereas in the third case we used cylindrical specimens with a         
  diameter of 3.5 and 5 mm (according to Procedure Recommendations in [7]).</p>        
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">In electrochemical investigation we measured the corrosion         
  potentials and recorded I-E polarization curves using standard methods [8,9].         
  The corrosion and electrochemical behaviour of the steels was also interpreted         
  on the basis of the data on the local distribution of alloying elements in the         
  steel obtained using &quot;CAMEBAX-MBX&quot; x-ray spectrum microanalyzer by

<SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT>  <p align="left">In a hot 30% MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution both steels are         
  susceptible to local depassivation as a result of the establishment of their         
  corrosion potential in the range of the pitting protection and pitting         
  potentials. Corrosion potential for 03X23H7M4 steel is â 0.02V (Fig. 2,         
  curve 2). Since SCC is initiated in corrosion resistant steels of this grade         
  in breakdown of the passivating film at - potentials more positive than the         
  pitting protection potential, steels show susceptibility to SCC in the hot

  sensitivity for 04X25H7AM3 steel is detected (which must be stressed) in

  potential (0.2V, SHE) of the metal is situated of 100mV from the pitting

  <p align="left">Thus the investigated cast dual-phase steels are promising         
  material for production of components which work under stress conditions in         
  aggressive environments, including hot environments with high pH. In cold and         
  hot tap water, and sea water as well as alkaline solutions steels can be used         
  without restrictions as regards to stresses. In the conditions with a possible         
  increase of chloride concentration the working stresses can be determined on         
  the basis of the threshold value. Cast 04X25H7AM3 and 03X23H7M4 steels are not         
  suitable for use in hydrogen charging processing environments, i.e., oil and         
  gas, which contain hydrogen sulfide, in acid solutions; in environments         
  causing hydrogen charging under cathodic protection.</p>
