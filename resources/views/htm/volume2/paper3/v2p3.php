  Plasma-polymerized coatings deposited on iron were synthesized in microwave
  plasma reactor. We have studied the influence of the HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> ratio
  mixture on the film structure by Infrared Spectroscopy. The variation of the
  HMDSO content in the feed gas provides a large wide of materials, from silica
  (HMDSO content : 20%) to polymer (HMDSO content &gt; 80%). The corrosion
  protection properties of the coatings were estimated by Electrochemical
  Impedance Spectroscopy. Coating parameters were obtained using a circuit
  analog model. An efficient corrosion protection of iron has been obtained.
  However, the protection depends on the structure of the coating.

<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  In the last few years, the corrosion protective properties of plasma-polymerised
  coatings based on organosilicone precursor have been studied [1-6]. These
  films show interesting properties: they are highly crosslinked, insoluble,
  pinhole-free and very adherent. Particularly, the organosilicone plasma-polymerised
  seems to be a good candidate to form priming layer for subsequent coating [6,
  7-9]. In some of our previous works [10-11], we studied the effects of
  hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)/O<sub>2</sub> mixture on the excited species in
  the plasma and on the structure of the coatings. The plasma polymerisation
  occured in a microwave reactor which are characterized by high rates of
  charged and neutral species (atoms, radicals ...) and consequently provided
  short time of deposition. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of
  HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> mixture on the corrosion protection properties. Plasma-polymerised
  films were deposited on iron samples under different HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub>
  ratios mixture and provide to a large wide of materials, from silica to
  polymers. The coatings characterization was investigated by IR spectroscopy.
  By using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and
  appropriate model (equivalent circuit), it is possible to obtain parameters
  which can be correlated to the protective properties of several plasma-polymerised
  coatings.
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Materials and experimental procedure</h3>
  The substrat materials, iron disks (purity 99,5%) 1,5 cm in diameter and 1 mm
  in thickness, was supplied by Goodfellow. Hexamethyldisiloxane (purity 98%)
  was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasma polymerisation was carried out in a
  large microwave plasma reactor sustained by a surface wave ; this apparatus is
  described in detail elsewhere [11].The microwave is excited at a 2.45 GHz
  frequency and put through a quartz tube thanks to an excitator built on the
  surfaguide principle. The microwave (MW) power delivered is 600 W.
  Furthermore, the substrate holder was biased by means of a 13.56 MHz
  radio-frequency (RF) generator at a fixed power 50W. The feed gases, oxygen
  and argon, are injected at the top of the tube whereas the HMDSO is injected
  in the flowing afterglow via a ring. The total pressure varied from 50 mTorr
  to 80 mTorr depending on the HMDSO to O<sub>2</sub> ratios. The flow rates
  were fixed at 76 sccm for (HMDSO + O<sub>2</sub>) and at 5 sccm for the argon.
  Four different percentage in the HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> mixture have been studied
  : 20/80, 50/50, 80/20 and 100/0. Before coating deposition, samples were
  treated in the microwave reactor without RF bias by oxygen plasma (150 sccm)
  during 10 min. The duration of coating deposition were varied from 6 min to 45
  min. After coating, microwave and RF powers were turned off and samples were
  left in the reactor during 15 min in an argon flow (900 sccm) for cooling. The
  film structure was analysed by means of reflection absorption IR (RAIR)
  measurements performed on a Br�cker IFS28 spectrometer. The spectra of the
  plasma-polymerized coatings were typically obtained by averaging 20 scans and
  then substracting the spectrum obtained from the substrate before deposition
  of the film. The film thickness was measured with a profilometer (Dektak 3030,
  Sloan). The samples were weighted before and after coating with a micro-scale
  balance (Sartorius MC210). The film weight was deduced by difference. The
  corrosion protection of the film was analysed by means of electrochemical
  impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. EIS data were obtained using a
  Schlumberger solartron 1255 frequency response analyser coupled to an EGG PAR
  273 potenstiostat/galvanostat. Impedance data were collected at frequencies
  ranging from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. Typically measurements were made at 5
  points/decade, 10 mV a.c. amplitude. An electrochemical cell with three
  electrodes was used. Coated iron sample was working electrode (area 0,8 cm<sup>2</sup>)
  and a platinum grille served as counter electrode. A saturated calomel
  reference electrode was employed. Experiments were conducted at room
  temperature with NaCl 0,1 mol.L<sup>-1</sup> electrolyte under Ar atmosphere.
  The experimental impedance spectra were interpretated on the basis of
  equivalent electrical circuits using a fitting software (EGG).

  <h4>Deposition rate and density</h4>
  <p>Table 1 shows weight, thickness and density for plasma-polymerised coating
  from different HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures and at several time deposition.
  One may notice the short deposition time values due to the used of a microwave
  plasma reactor. The density values are obtained with precision near to 20%. At
  low HMDSO percentage, the highest density is obtained : it is close to the one
  of thermal silica (2,22 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>). For higher HMDSO content in the
  feed, the densities seem to be constant with a value around 1,5 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT>  <h4>Coating characterization by IR spectroscopy</h4>
  <p>The structure and bondings in the deposited films have been studied by
  means of IR spectroscopy (Figure 1). According to the litterature <font size="3">[11-13]</font>,
  the absortion bands can be assigned as follow : 790-800 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Si-C
  stretching and CH<sub>3</sub> rocking in Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), 835
  cm<sup>-1</sup> (Si-C stretching and CH<sub>3</sub> rocking in Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>),
  880 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> rocking and bending),
  1000-1100 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(Si-O asymmetric stretching), 1260 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(CH<sub>3
  </sub>symmetric bending in Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>X</sub>), a weak band at
  1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> (-CH<sub>2</sub>- scissoring and wagging vibrations in
  disilymethylene Si-CH<sub>2</sub>-Si), 1408 cm<sup>-1 </sup>( CH<sub>3 </sub>symmetric
  bending in<sup> </sup>Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>X</sub>), 1458 cm<sup>-1</sup>
  ((CH)<sub>X</sub> asymmetric bending), 1710 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(C=O groups),
  2900-2960 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(CH<sub>X</sub> symmetric and asymmetric
  stretching), 2100-2250 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Si-H stretching vibration). With
  increasing O<sub>2</sub> in the HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> mixture, the relative
  intensities of the absortion band at 1260 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(characteristic of
  Si-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>X</sub>) is seen to decrease and the one of the band
  at 1000-1100 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(Si-O) increase. We consider that this is because
  of a decrease in the relative amount of organic content and to the high degree
  of crosslinking in the coating. This view is supported by measurement of the
  film density. The highest density is obtained at high O<sub>2</sub> content in
  the feed. One may conclude that plasma-polymerised coatings obtained from
  HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> could be considered as polymer like or silica like as a
  function of O<sub>2</sub> content in the feed.&nbsp;</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT>  <p>The RAIR spectra of coatings, obtained from several HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub>
  mixture after exposure of the iron coated samples to NaCl for eight days,
  didn't show any change in the films. This fact demonstrates the chemical
  stability of these plasma-polymerised coatings. <i>Corrosion protection
  properties by EIS </i>The frequency dependence of the electrochemical
  impedance of a polymer coated iron sample usually can be modeled by an
  equivalent circuit shown in Figure 2 [14 - 17]. This model will be tested for
  the thin HMDSO plasma-polymerised coating. The non-conducting organic coating
  appears as a capacitor C<sub>c</sub> called coating capacitance. Ionically
  conducting paths either due to the presence of defects or pores, or due to the
  slight degree of solvatation of water and ions by the coating, produce finite
  resistance R<sub>por</sub> (pore resistance), that short the coating. In
  series with this resistive element is a parallel resistance R<sub>pol</sub> (polarisation
  resistance) and the double layer capacitance C<sub>dl</sub>, representing the
  corrosion process at the electrolyte-saturated coating/metal interface.
  Finally, in series with the entire network representing the coated surface is
  R<sub>sol</sub> : the electrolyte resistance due to ohmic drop within the
  electrolyte which is negligible in the case of coatings immersed in 0,1 mol.L<sup>-1</sup>
  NaCl.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT>  <p><b>Figure 2 : The equivalent circuit used to model coated
  electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT>  <p>The initial coating capacitance C<sub>c</sub> is the lowest for silica-like
  coating (D) which has the thickest coating layer (Figure 3(a)). Coatings A, B
  and C have the same thickness but sample A has a lower C<sub>c</sub> value
  This fact could be correlated to the excited species present in the plasma
  during deposition [10]. The low atomic oxygen concentration in the plasma
  provide to a coating less crosslinked. And hence this coating possesses the
  lower barrier properties. The increase of C<sub>c</sub> in the first day of
  exposure is considered due to water uptake by the coating. In fact, the
  coating capacitance increases with increasing water uptake [14]. The volume
  fraction V of electrolyte absorbed by the coating can be generally determined
  from the experimental values of C<sub>c</sub> [18] as follow: v = log(C<sub>c</sub>(t)/C<sub>c</sub>(0))/log80
  (1) where C<sub>c</sub>(t) is the coating capacitance at time t and C<sub>c</sub>(0)
  is the initial coating capacitance. The application of equation (1) allow to
  high volumique fraction of water penetrated close to 1. These values have not
  been confirmed by weight mesearements. In fact, the thickness of the plasma
  polymerised coating is very low comparatively to the classical organic
  protective coating and consequently, R<sub>por</sub> is so low and C<sub>c</sub>
  cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy to determine water uptake[17].
  Figure 3(b) shows that the pore resistance R<sub>por</sub> decreased the most
  for coating A. At the end of exposure, R<sub>por</sub> was the lowest for
  sample A but the R<sub>por</sub> values of B, C and D coatings were similar.
  The increase of C<sub>dl</sub> (Figure 3(c)) can be considered as evidence
  that the area at which delamination was increasing. This increase occured
  first and was the largest for sample A. The initial C<sub>dl </sub>value of
  the silica-like coating (D) is the lowest but it doesn't vary very much with
  time exposure. The decrease of R<sub>pol </sub>(Figure 3(d)), which suggests
  an increase of the delaminated area at the metal/coating interface is the
  largest for sample A. This analysis of EIS data for this four coatings systems
  shows qualitatively that the polymer-like coating A suffer the higher
  degradation and corrosion at the metal/coating interface during exposure to
  NaCl for eight days while B, C and D samples seem to have similar protective
  properties and show good performance relatively to the low thicknesses of all
  the coatings. Several parameters have been related to the delaminated area
  [14]. The polarization resistance has been used to estimate the delaminated
  area because R<sub>pol</sub> is obtained with most accuracy. Assuming that A<sub>d</sub>
  is equal to the corroding area, one obtains the following relation ship : A<sub>d</sub>
  = R<sup>0</sup><sub>pol</sub>/R<sub>pol</sub> (2) The specific polarization
  resistance, R<sup>0</sup><sub>pol</sub> is associated with the charge transfer
  behavior of the metal substrate and can be estimated using the linear
  polarization of an uncoated sample. The value of R<sup>0</sup><sub>pol</sub>
  is assumed to be constant. A<sub>d</sub> has been calculated for the plasma-polymerised
  coating obtained from the HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> 80/20 mixture. The results are
  reported in table 2 and is coherent with the corroding area observed. The
  delaminated area seems to stabilize around 0.015 cm<sup>2</sup> after 4 days
  of immersion in NaCl.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT>  &nbsp; To improve the barrier properties of the plasma-polymerised coatings,
  we have increased the thickness to 0,5 <font face="Symbol">m</font>m to 4 <font face="Symbol">m</font>m
  (samples B, E, F and G). This serie of coating were synthezised from a HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub>

  well known that the increasing of thickness of plasma-polymerised coating
  provide to the increasing of the strains and could favorise microcracks

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT>  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  In this work, plasma-polymerized coatings deposited on iron were synthesized
  in microwave plasma reactor. We have studied the influence of the HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub>
  ratio mixture on the film structure (RAIR spectroscopy) and on the protective
  properties (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). The structure of the
  plasma-polymerised coatings has been found close to the thermal silica for low
  HMDSO content in the feed (HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> : 20/80) and polymeric for
  higher HMDSO/O<sub>2</sub> ratios mixture. From the results obtained by EIS
  measurements for different plasma-polymerised coatings, deposited on iron,
  exposed in NaCl during eight days, the following conclusions were drawn : - An
  efficient corrosion protection of iron has been obtained by these coatings
  synthesized in the microwave plasma reactor. Nevertheless, the quality of the
  protection depends on the HMDSO content in the feed gas. - The plasma-polymerised
  coating from pur HMDSO had the lowest barrier and protective properties. - The
  best protection is achieved for the plasma-polymerized coating at 80% HMDSO in
  the mixture with a thickness of 1 <font face="Symbol">m</font>m. However the
  results obtained for coating at 50% and 20% HMDSO lead nearly to similar
  protective properties.
