<h4>Introduction</h4>
Electrochemical methods have been studied for the quantitative analysis of degradation of coated metal so far.  We developed an under-film corrosion tester using the current interrupter technique.  The data obtained from the under-film corrosion tester were discussed comparing that from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in this paper.  Both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and current interrupter method give parameters of natural potential(E), film resistance(Rf), film capacitance(Cf), resistance of charge transfer(Rct) and capacitance of double layer(Cdl). 
<h4>Experimental</h4>
The parameters mentioned above were measured for evaluating protective properties of  the following coated films    
Alkyd clear (La),  
lead cyanamid alkyd paint(La-P) 
TiO<sub>2  </sub>pigmented epoxy paint 
Mild steel(JIS G 3141) was used as a substrate.  The sample paints were coated by an applicator and a spray.  Dry film thickness of 20µm, 60µm and 100µm was obtained for each paint.  Sodium chloride solution of  3 wt% was used as a test solution.
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
It was found that there was a good co-relation between the data from the two methods.  However, the maximum value measurable in case of film resistance of both the current interrupter and  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were more than 10<sup>10  </sup>?cm<sup>2</sup> and  5x10<sup>8 </sup> ?cm<sup>2  </sup>respectably.
The current interrupter method had advantages and that is, gave some parameters which means useful not only for anti-corrosive performances but also for the analysis of corrosion mechanism.
