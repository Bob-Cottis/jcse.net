  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  Filiform corrosion is a localised form of attack that usually occurs beneath
  paint films and leads to the appearance of thread-like filaments. It is
  generally considered to result from contamination on the metal surface and
  will only propagate in humid conditions. The type of pretreatment used prior
  to painting has a very important influence on the subsequent occurrence of
  filiform corrosion. Chromate containing pretreatments have been widely used
  commercially, although alternatives are being actively sought on health and
  environmental grounds. A considerable range of susceptibility can be displayed
  between different alloys. It has been unclear whether this range of behaviour
  is caused by differences in the alloy compositions or by some feature of their
  microstructure or surface condition. In the work described in this paper the
  individual factors that influence an alloy&#146;s susceptibility to filiform
  corrosion have been studied in detail. In particular, the effects of various
  cleaning methods and chromating treatments have been investigated, together
  with the influence of surface contamination, grain structure and mechanical
  and electrochemical polishing.<u>
  <p>Surface Treatments.</u> Filiform corrosion tests were performed on 3003 and
  3105 aluminium alloys. Panels 145 mm x 80 mm of the mill finished alloys were
  prepared using a variety of cleaning and pretreatment methods. The standard
  pretreatment was [1] Clean in acetone [2] Alkaline clean in Ridoline 1806
  (30s) [3] Rinse in tap water [4] Acid rinse in 23% HNO<sub>3</sub> (15s) [5]
  Distilled water rinse. The influence of each experimental variable was
  investigated separately by omitting or adding steps in the standard treatment
  as shown in Table 1. For example, some panels were prepared by cleaning in
  acetone alone and others had the additional step of cleaning in 1M NaOH. The
  effects of different chromating treatments were investigated by varying the
  time of exposure to the Alochrom bath. In general, two replicate specimens
  were produced for each condition. The panels were then painted by bar coating
  with 3-5 microns of polyester primer, dried at 120C and given 13-15 microns of
  polyester top coat.

Filiform Corrosion Testing.</u> The painted panels were tested using the
standard filiform method BS X 32: 1991. A scribe 2mm wide and 0.15 mm deep was
produced in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Filiform corrosion was
initiated by exposure to HCl vapour for 1 hour and the panels were then tested
at 42C and 82% RH for 1000 hours. The extent of filiform corrosion was
quantitatively assessed by measuring the lengths of the filaments that developed
on each scribe using a Leica 500QMC image analyser.
<b>
  <h4>Results</h4>
</b>
  It was found that the most useful measure of the extent of filiform corrosion
  was the total length of the filaments that developed on the 70 mm long scribe
  during the 1000 hours exposure. In each case, these total lengths were
  expressed as Relative Filament Lengths (%) by comparing them with those that
  formed on 3003A when tested in the painted, mill finished condition, without
  any form of pretreatment. The results of the filiform testing are summarised
  in Fig 1.
  By performing tests in which different areas of the panels were polished in
  either the longitudinal or transverse direction it was possible to distinguish
  between effects caused by the surface layer and those due to the substrate. In
  other tests, the elongated grains were recrystallised by heat treatment at
  535C to investigate the influence of the substrate microstructure. The results
  indicate that filiform corrosion behaviour is influenced most strongly by the
  properties of the original surface layer.

<b>
  <h4>Conclusions</h4>
</b>[1] The filiform corrosion susceptibility of aluminium sheet was shown to be
more closely related to the condition of the original surface layer than to the
microstructure of the substrate. This was due to the presence on the surface of
high temperature oxides, rolling lubricants and other contaminants from
processing.
<p>[2] Solvent cleaning of the aluminium prior to painting could reduce some of
the subsequent development of corrosion filaments but those treatments that
removed the original mill finished surface layer were found to be more
effective.
<p>[3] The use of appropriate alkaline cleaning, together with mechanical or
electrochemical polishing, was able to control filiform corrosion to a similar
extent to a chromate conversion coating.
<p>[4] Electropolishing the surface gave the greatest reduction in filament
development. This was attributed both to the efficient removal of the surface
layer and to the production of a microscopically flat surface, free from the
polishing irregularities that promote filiform corrosion.
