<p>This paper presents the results
of the research on the corrosion resistance of a new system of amorphous
alloys, i.e. Fe-Co-Cr-B-Si. The corrosion behaviour of amorphous alloys as well
as that of any other crystalline alloys may be determined both by internal
factors (alloy structure and composition) and by external factors (aggressive
medium type, concentration and PH-coefficient). The lack of crystallinity and
of defects specific to the crystalline condition-grain boundaries, dislocations
and segregations ensure a high corrosion resistance to amorphous alloys in
spite of their being metastable thermodynamically. The research was performed
through the gravimetric method on Fe<sub>75-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>
amorphous alloys ribbons obtained by the melt-spinning technique. This research
showed the influence of the alloy chemical composition, i.e. the increase of Co
percentage and working medium: 0.5N HCl, 1N HCl and 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
on corrosion resistance. The best results were recorded with: Fe<sub>65</sub>Co<sub>10</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><p>Electrochemically, interest in
metallic glasses aroused since their appearance. In 1974 Naka, Hashimoto and
Masumoto [1] brought into evidence both the corrosion resistance and the
inertness in various aqueous electrolytes. It is believed that all sources of
localised corrosion disappear in the absence of the common structural defects
such as the grain boundaries, dislocations and segregations. Structure,
chemical composition and material homogeneity are the factors influencing the
electrochemical behaviour of amorphous alloys. Lack of sensitivity of an
amorphous alloy to intergranular corrosion is apparently due to grain
boundaries and segregations associated with them. A majority of amorphous
alloys are passive in aqueous</span>
media. Considering the remarkable corrosion resistance of Fe, Ni, Co-based
amorphous alloys it is important to explain the electrochemical action of
amorphous elements (P, B and Si) as well as their segregation (coagulation)
with alloying elements having a metallic character (Cr, Mo and W). This
behaviour may be studied electrochemical by through polarisation curves,
gravimetry, electrochemical impedance, etc<b>.
</b>in the field of active dissolutions, in the active-passive transitional
field as well as in that of the passivisation. Analysis of the surface by
different methods allows the determination of the composition of passive strata
and the distribution of the alloying elements within these elements. The effect
of Cr on the corrosion resistance of amorphous alloys is more as compared to
that of crystalline alloys [1]. The behaviour of Fe-Cr-P ternary alloys in aggressive
media such as 1N HCl as compared to stainless steel is obvious. The efficiency
of simultaneous alloying with Cr and P is superior to that of Cr and B and
should consequently be emphasized. The FeCr<sub>10</sub>P<sub>13</sub>C<sub>7</sub>
amorphous alloy passivates spontaneously in an aggressive medium. The passive
film contains chromium hydroxide monohydrate. The previous studies showed
[1,2,3] that the optimum enrichment in Cr in the case of passive films attains
a maximum value with amorphous alloys showing 95% cations as compared with
noticeable values in the case of conventional ferrite steels showing 58-75%
cations. Comparison of the effect of other amorphizing elements underlines the
special position phosphorus holds. In the case of steels including P, B or Si
the mentioned above amorphizing elements cause the formation of a chromium
borate or silicate which limits the percentage of this element available for
the formation of the protective film of chrome hydrated chromium hydroxide
monohydrate.</p>

shows very small scallops produced by gases rallied by the liquid metal jet.

<SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>The surface of samples was also
studied after the corrosion test. The ribbon surface contacting the rotating
support shows a higher corrosion resistance than the surface in the opposite
zone. This can be explained by the cooling of the two surfaces at different
rates. Due to the lower cooling speed crystalline nuclei could form on the
external surface (but this process was not confirmed through the X-ray
diffraction). The present study has been performed in order to investigate the
effect of an increase of cobalt content on the corrosion resistance of the
series of amorphous alloys Fe<sub>75-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>.
The histograms of Fig.3 show the dependence of corrosion rate of Fe<sub>75-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>
alloys on the cobalt content in (a) 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, (b) 1N HCl
and (c) 0.5N HCl. The variation of corrosion resistance expressed by the
penetration coefficient is observable in the following: </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>The amorphous metallic alloys are
thermodynamically instable. The corrosion behaviour in the case of the
amorphous alloys as well as in that of any crystalline alloys may be influenced
both by internal factors (the alloy composition, the nature of the components,
the presence of the metalloids) and by external ones (aggressive medium
ph-coefficient and composition). Irrespective of the corrosive medium, the
amorphous alloys have a better and better behaviour proportionally with
increase of cobalt concentration, which is obvious in figures 3-4. This effect
may be explained by the behaviour of cobalt itself. Cobalt may be considered a
somehow noble metal characterized by low corrosion rates in neutral aqueous
solutions, without oxidants, and low corrosion rates in acid solutions. The
studies performed by Angelini and his collaborators [2] indicate a tendency of
cobalt to become passive in the presence of water through the appearance of an
oxide film. In the case of some mixtures having a high percentage of iron, the
reaction of non-adherent products typically produced by this metal results in a
continuous weight loss of the sample. At high percentage cobalt forms of a
shallow protective film, probably a more or less hydrated oxide, which prevents
further corrosion. Quantitative analysis of the elements dissolved in 0.5 N and
1N HCl solutions illustrates the
following (see Figs.3b and 3c): </p>

<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>(1) In more aggressive solutions
alloys with low Co content are dissolved with rates whose values are close to
those of the nominal alloys.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>(2) In almost neutral solutions
alloys with high Co content dissolve at rates perceptibly different from those
of the nominal compositions.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>The figure 5 shows the results of quantitative analysis for
iron and cobalt dissolved in the 0.5N HCl. The data in the table refer to the
percentage composition variations of the elements (related to the total losses
in weight through corrosion) of iron and cobalt of the amorphous alloys. In
this case (Fig.5) the dissolved iron content decreases with increasing cobalt
content in the amorphous alloy, but the cobalt content in solution increases
with its concentration the amorphous alloy.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>The Fe-Co-Cr-B-Si alloys are
weakly reacted by sulphuric acid and its penetration coefficient ranges between <span style="background-color: #00FF00">20
and 40 </span>
mm/year, as compared to the behaviour in HCl in which the penetration
coefficient is between <span style="background-color: #00FF00">4 and 14</span> mm/year. The present study
underlines the importance of the corrosive medium concentration. Practically
the penetration coefficients are identical (in case the samples are kept in 1N
hydrochloric acid for four hours) with those kept in 0.5N hydrochloric acid.
The passivation of amorphous alloy increases with increasing concentration of
HCl.</p>

<h3>4. Conclusions</h3>

<SCRIPT>comment(18)</SCRIPT><p>Fe<sub>75-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>
amorphous ribbons corrosion behaviour improves with the increase of the alloy
Co percentage. The Fe percentage decrease from 75 to 65 in favour of Co as well
as the tendency of the latter to become passive in the presence of water
through the formation of a protective oxide layer accounts for the results
recorded with the Fe<sub>65</sub>Co<sub>10</sub>Cr<sub>1</sub>B<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>17</sub>
alloy. The nature and concentration of the ions in the corrosive medium as well
as the solution <span style="background-color: #00FF00">pH</span> have an impact on the corrosion rate of
amorphous metallic alloys. With the case we studied the penetration
coefficients are identical when samples are kept in 1N HCl for 4 hours with
those recorded when samples are kept for 2 hours in 0.5N HCl. With higher HCl
concentrations the amorphous alloy becomes passive. Different corrosion
behaviours were also recorded with the external and internal ribbon surface
with FeCoCrBSi alloys. These behavioural differences are the result of some
structural differences (relaxation defects, composition fluctuations) created
by the cooling speed differences on solidification.</p>
