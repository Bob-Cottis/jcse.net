    <p>This review considers the past fifty one years of study in the field of
    corrosion prevention by organic coatings. It concentrates mainly on the
    mechanisms associated with the paint binder. Areas covered include the
    importance of the coating ionic resistance and the concept of D and I areas.
    The effect of the environment on the ionic resistance is examined.
    Blistering and delamination is considered in the light of movement of ions
    through coatings and along interfaces. Specific attention is paid to the
    metal paint interface with emphasis on adhesion, underfilm contamination and
    surface tolerant coatings.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><p><b>Keywords: </b>anti-corrosion paints, ionic transport, blistering,
    cathodic disbonding, underfilm contamination, surface tolerant coatings</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>In this review, we are concerned with the effects of the polymeric binder
    and the anti-corrosion properties of paints. Aspects of corrosion inhibition
    by anti-corrosion pigments have not been emphasized. Also within the field
    of underfilm corrosion and blistering, we have not considered the the highly
    important and topical area of filiform corrosion.</p>
    <h3>Inhibition of Corrosion by Barrier Coatings</h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Any discussion which considers the prevention of aqueous metallic
    corrosion, usually takes as its starting point the electrochemical model of
    the corrosion of mild steel in a neutral electrolyte with the four important
    processes involved linked in series namely; the anodic reaction, the cathodic reaction
    and the conductive
    pathways for ions and electrons. Inhibition of the anodic or cathodic
    reactions or an interruption of the ionic flow will cause the rate of
    corrosion to be significantly reduced.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title>[1]</a>&nbsp; Thus, all
    corrosion prevention measures are aimed at removing or suppressing one of
    the three elements. &nbsp; One of the most convenient, and
    certainly the oldest method of protecting a substrate from the detrimental
    effects of the environment, is to coat it with a polymeric barrier paint to
    isolate it from its surroundings.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title>[2]</a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title>[3]</a>
    This barrier might be due purely to the properties of the polymer, or to the
    inclusion of inert pigments that act to increase the length of the diffusion
    path through the coating.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>The inclusion of inert pigments into the film can increase the
    effectiveness of the coating providing the formulation is not too heavily
    loaded.&nbsp; Too high a concentration of pigment is liable to reduce the
    effectiveness of the coating.&nbsp; The Critical Pigment Volume
    Concentration has been shown to be a transition point where a number
    of significant features of the coating change.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title>[4]</a>,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title>[5]</a>
    &nbsp;The loading of a coating with pigment particles is made more complex
    by the effect of the distribution of pigment particle size.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title>[6]</a>&nbsp;
    A wide range of pigment particle sizes favours a high Pigment Volume
    Concentration. <font color="#FF0000">David

    <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>The nature of this barrier has been the subject of much work over many
    years by workers in the field of protective organic coatings.&nbsp; The
    original assumption was that organic coatings act as a barrier to water and
    oxygen from the environment<a name="_Ref477516736"></a><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title>[7]</a>.&nbsp;
    Scientific investigations
    of the subject over the last half century have determined that the limiting factor in the protective
    mechanisms of barrier coatings is frequently their resistance to the flow of ionic
    current.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title>[8]</a></p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc478818763">Electrolytic Resistance of Organic Coatings</a></h3>
    <p><img src="v3p5_image002.gif" align="left" width="304" height="301"><a name="_Toc468603853"></p>

    immersed metals after ref <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title>[9]</a></b></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>The importance of the electrolytic resistance of organic coatings has
    long been appreciated.&nbsp; Bacon, Smith and Rugg<a name="_Ref443900310">,</a><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title>[9]</a>
    after measuring the resistances of over 300 coating systems, determined a
    direct correlation between these resistances and the ability of the coating
    to protect the underlying steel from corrosion. Three general
    classifications, based on a sustained resistance value, were established
    during this investigation: good, fair and poor - see Figure 1.&nbsp; The
    classification that a coating was allocated was dependant upon its long term
    resistance value upon immersion in solution �Most coatings, if continuous,
    have resistances in the neighbourhood of Log R = 9 during the first 5 to 10
    minutes of immersion, followed by a decrease in resistance which may vary
    considerably in steepness and duration�, the units of R were Ohms for one
    sq. cm.&nbsp; Their subsequent behaviour determined which category they
    should be placed into.&nbsp; All coatings were found to exhibit an initial
    decrease in resistance, which varied in terms of rate and duration.&nbsp;
    For a good coating, this initial decrease was followed by an abrupt recovery
    to around the original value.&nbsp; The subsequent resistance of the coating
    remained either essentially constant or fluctuated within the high
    resistance region.&nbsp; A coating designated as fair either levelled off or
    displayed a slight increase in resistance.&nbsp; However, a subsequent sharp
    drop in resistance was a pre-cursor to coating failure, which occurred
    within six months of the exposure period.&nbsp; The resistance of a poor
    coating continued to decrease resulting in failure within sixty days.&nbsp;
    A coating that maintained a resistance of 10<sup>8 </sup>Ohm cm<sup>2</sup>
    provided good corrosion protection while one whose resistance fell below 10<sup>6
    </sup>Ohm cm<sup>2</sup> did not.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>Although this work identified the relationship between the ionic
    resistance of the coatings and their ability to protect, the permeability of
    other corrosive agents other than ionic species was not considered.&nbsp;
    Therefore, the results were presented as providing a measure of the likely
    protection that could be expected from a particular system rather than
    proposing a mechanism for the protective action of organic coatings.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>The Effect of the Environment on the Performance of Coatings</h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>A further important result from the work of Bacon, Smith and Rugg
    identified the effect of the environment on the protective merit of coated
    submerged steel.&nbsp; One of the variables taken into consideration was the
    level of dissolved salts in the test solution.&nbsp; It was found that the
    resistance of the coating fell with increasing salt concentration and from
    this result it was concluded that the dissolution of environmental water
    into the coating was more important than the uptake of salt from the
    solution by the coating. That the level of dissolved salts of the exposure
    environment had an effect on the properties of coatings had been reported
    previously by Kittelberger and Elm <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title>[10]</a>.&nbsp;
    This work showed a relationship between the level of dissolved salts in the
    solution, expressed as osmotic pressure, and the water uptake of the films
    under investigation, expressed as percentage weight gain.&nbsp; It was shown
    that the nature of the solute did not affect the results; rather it was the
    osmotic pressure that determined the level of imbibition is this a word? of
    water into the coating.&nbsp; When the coatings were exposed to a salt
    solution, after an initial high rate of water absorption, the curve levelled
    off and eventually an equilibrium was attained.&nbsp; Where the films were
    exposed to distilled water, however, no equilibrium was reached and the film
    continued to gain in weight.&nbsp; It was concluded that the degree of water
    absorption was a function of the activity of the water in solution, due to
    the differences in osmotic pressure between the exposure solution and that
    within the film, see Figure 2.</p>

    <h3><a name="_Toc478818765">Permeability of Organic Coatings to Corrosive
    Species</a></h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>In order that a paint coating should offer protection from corrosion, it
    should interact with one or other of the processes involved in the overall
    series of corrosion reactions. This was
    considered by Mayne<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title>[11]</a>, who
    determined that the permeability of organic coatings to both water and
    oxygen is so high that the rate at which they arrive at the interface of the
    coating and the steel is greater than that required for corrosion to proceed
    and so could not be rate determining. Therefore, Mayne reasoned that the
    method by which an unpigmented coating protects steel from corrosion was by
    the introduction of a path of high electrolytic resistance in between the
    metal and the environment; the term resistance inhibition was coined for
    this mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc478818767">Selective Permeability of Organic Coatings</a></h4>
    <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Further work by Mayne<a name="_Ref476986155"> </a><a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title>[12]</a>
    showed that, upon immersion in water or an aqueous solution of electrolyte,
    most organic coatings acquire a negative charge.&nbsp; According to Mayne,
    the acquisition of this charge has the effect of creating a selectively
    permeable membrane, which is preferentially permeable to cations; that is, a
    film that has gained a negative charge due to immersion may be regarded as a
    large poly-anion.&nbsp; An alternative view is expressed by Corti et al <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title>[13]</a>,
    who claim that a charged film would slow down the passage of counter ions
    (those having the opposite charge) whilst having no effect on the movement
    of co-ions through the film.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>These contradictory views stem from the proposed mode of transport of
    ions across the film.&nbsp; According to Corti, the rate of permeation
    across the film is affected by the presence of small imperfections or pores,
    which extend through the film and have cross sections distinctly larger than
    the free areas normally present between the atomic groups in the membrane
    matrix.&nbsp; Mayne�s model, on the other hand, infers that the passage of
    ions is through the bulk matrix of the film.&nbsp; If the ionic conduction
    takes place through pores, it is reasonable to claim that a negative charge
    on the polymer would impede the passage of cations due to electrostatic
    attraction between the ions and the pore walls.&nbsp; However, if the
    movement of ions through the coating is considered to be through the bulk of
    the film, the proposal that a negative charge on the film would act as a
    repulsive force towards anions seems plausible.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>Transport of cations through polymer films has been observed elsewhere<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title>[14]</a>
    with the passage of iron ions through a range of coatings on steel immersed
    in NaCl.&nbsp; These coatings were continuous and free from defects and the
    ionic transport was considered to have taken place through the bulk
    polymer.&nbsp; Of the coatings tested, a �practical anticorrosive coal tar
    epoxy� was found to retard the process.&nbsp; The inference of this work
    is that the conduction of ions through the film takes place through the bulk
    polymer.&nbsp; The work reviewed in the following section proposed
    mechanisms to account for this.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc478818768">Mechanisms of Through Film Transport of Ions</a></h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>Ionic conduction through the bulk of the polymer matrix was studied by
    Maitland and Mayne<a name="_Ref445095949">.</a><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title>[15]</a>&nbsp;
    This work, which mainly considered the properties of an unattached,
    unpigmented pentaerythritol alkyd varnish, found that the resistance of the
    film was affected by the state of the exposure solution and identified two
    distinct processes, which took place in succession of each other: The Fast
    Change and The Slow Change.&nbsp; The Fast Change was observed to take place
    within a few minutes of immersion where the films attained a steady
    resistance value, R<sub>o</sub>.&nbsp; This was followed by The Slow Change,
    which took place over a number of weeks or months.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>The Fast Change was shown to be a reversible process and was independent
    of both the nature of the solute in the exposure solution and the state of
    the film in respect of the slow change.&nbsp; The controlling factor in the
    process was seen to be the osmotic pressure or water activity of the
    solution; this process is shown in Figure 3</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p>The Slow Change was considered to be controlled by the concentration of
    the electrolyte in solution.&nbsp; This was confirmed by experiment, whereby
    the reaction was accelerated by an increase in temperature.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p>Maitland associated this phenomenon with an ion exchange process where
    cations from the electrolyte were exchanged with hydrogen ions from carboxyl
    groups within the polymer.&nbsp; The ion exchange behaviour was found to be
    affected by the pH of the system or the concentration of potassium ions in
    solution.&nbsp; An increase in either the pH or the potassium concentration
    resulted in a greater rate of ion exchange, causing a fall in the resistance
    of the coating.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>Work on the effect of the Slow Change on the reversibility of the Fast
    Change was carried out by Cherry and Mayne,<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title>[16]</a><a name="_Ref445621408"><sup>,</sup></a><a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title>[17]</a>
    who found that the coatings under investigation altered their mode of
    conduction at a given value of pH, the value of which varied according to
    the particular coating.&nbsp; Working on the assumption that the slow change
    was an ion exchange process, it was postulated that the resistance of the
    film should be a function of the ratio of the activities of the metal cation
    from the electrolyte (in this case potassium) and that of the hydrogen
    ions.&nbsp; The term rK was defined, where:</p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>Films were conditioned in solutions of various <i>rK</i> values and then
    the temperature coefficient of resistance for each film was measured.&nbsp;
    It was found that there was a small range of <i>rK</i> values, specific to
    each polymer, where the mode of conduction ceased to run counter to that of
    the solution and commenced to follow it.&nbsp; The point where this change
    in the conductive behaviour of the film took place was named the reversal
    point and was seen to indicate a change in the mechanism of ion transport
    from one of activated diffusion to that of aqueous conduction.&nbsp; This
    conduction was considered to take place through virtual pores.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>The model whereby the electrolytic conduction takes place through pores
    is supported by Miskovic et al<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title>[18]</a>
    who, as a result of their AC impedance examination of electrodeposited
    epoxy, proposed a model whereby electrolytic conduction through a coating is
    dependant only on conduction through macro-pores.&nbsp; These pores were
    examined microscopically and were determined to have radii between 3 and
    7.2�m.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc478818769">Modes of Ionic Conduction Through Polymer Films</a></h4>
    <SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT><p>The question of the possibility of conduction through pores was addressed
    by Kinsella<a name="_Ref477745065">.</a><a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title>[19]</a>&nbsp;
    This work identified different modes of ionic conduction through polymer
    films.&nbsp; Two distinct forms of conduction were identified.&nbsp; The
    first was I, or inverse type conduction, where the resistance of the film
    coincided with that of the solution; this type of conduction was in line
    with that identified by Bacon, Smith and Rugg <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title>[9]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><p>The second mode of through-film transport that was identified was named
    D, or direct type conduction where the film�s resistance ran counter to
    that of the solution�s. Initially, the films that exhibited D type
    conduction were thought to be due to coating deficiencies such as dust wicks
    passing across the film.&nbsp; However, investigation of the temperature
    coefficients of resistance for these films showed them to be higher than
    that of aqueous conduction.&nbsp; In addition, the films were shown to be
    preferentially cation permeable and thus considered to be continuous.</p>

    &nbsp;</b></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p>A series of papers were produced as a result of this work, which
    addressed various different factors affecting ionic conduction in polymer
    films. <a name="_Ref444419341">The first</a><a name="_Ref445626064">,</a><a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title>[20]</a>
    examined the influence of the electrolyte on the resistance of films.&nbsp;
    It was found that the films investigated followed the general trend
    exhibited in Figure 4.&nbsp; However, when an I Type film was exposed to a
    solution of very low electrolyte concentration, and therefore a high water
    activity, the film displayed D Type characteristics over a small range of
    concentrations, at the lower end of the scale. Once the electrolyte
    concentration reached a critical level, the film began to exhibit more
    typical I Type characteristics.&nbsp; This led to the oft quoted conclusion that the
    difference between D and I Type conduction was �more one of degree rather
    than of kind�.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p>Scantlebury examined the distribution of D and I Type areas across a
    given film.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title>[21]</a>&nbsp; It was
    found that the films investigated were all very inhomogeneous and had a
    distribution of both D and I Type areas over the film.&nbsp; Two
    conclusions, relating to the mechanisms responsible for the different modes
    of conduction were drawn from this investigation.&nbsp; Firstly, that D Type
    conduction could not be attributed to the presence of pores unless they were
    of molecular dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(29)</SCRIPT><p>The second conclusion that was drawn from this study, was that the
    resistance of both D and I Type areas bore a relationship to their hardness
    values, as determined via microhardness tests.&nbsp; D Type areas were found
    overall to have a lower hardness value than that obtained for I Type.&nbsp;
    The hardness of the film was equated to its crosslinking density.&nbsp; This
    result was reinforced by swelling experiments, which showed that D Type
    areas swelled to a greater degree than I Type.&nbsp; Therefore, it was
    concluded that D Type conduction was a function of lower crosslink density
    in the film.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p>This conclusion reinforced Kinsella�s view <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title>[20]</a>
    that the initial drying conditions had a marked effect on the final
    properties of the film.&nbsp; Other work on crosslink densities of polymer
    films has shown that the crosslink density appears only to affect the ionic
    conductivity of the film.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title>[22]</a>&nbsp;
    The study was concerned with the effect of crosslink density upon water
    permeation through films and concluded that the permeation of water was not
    noticeably affected by alteration of the crosslink density.&nbsp; The final
    two papers in the series by Mayne and co-workers considered the influence of
    temperature<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title>[23]</a> and finally the
    effect on the barrier properties of a coating due to the inclusion of inert
    pigments.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title>[24]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p>Evidence that D Type areas are detrimental to the protective properties
    of organic coatings was produced by Mills<a name="_Ref477745245">,</a> <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title>[25]</a>
    who showed a direct relationship between the presence of D Type areas in the
    film and the occurrence of underfilm corrosion.&nbsp; With regard to the
    term �virtual pores� put forward by Cherry<sup>17</sup> to explain the
    mode of conduction in an apparently continuous film, Mills suggests the term
    �conductive polymer phase� as more appropriate<a name="_Ref477745338">.</a><a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title>[26]</a>&nbsp;
    This term is intended to describe more accurately the apparent properties of
    D Type films.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p>Mills further observed that the proportion of D Type areas was a function
    of the thickness of the film.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title>[27]</a>&nbsp;
    It was found that the incidence of D Type areas decreased significantly once
    the film�s thickness was increased to around 75&#956;m, this finding was
    used to conclude that D Type areas were spherical and approximately&nbsp; 75&#956;m
    diameter.</p>
    <h3>Breakdown Mechanisms of Coatings</h3>
    <h4><a name="_Toc478818771">Blistering and Delamination</a></h4>
    <SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT><p>Amongst the most common forms of failure found in organic coatings are
    those of blistering and delamination.&nbsp; Much debate has ensued as a
    result of the research into these failure modes and a number of governing
    mechanisms have been put forward.&nbsp; The mechanisms involved in the two
    modes of failure are similar, but it is unclear whether they are the same
    phenomena.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT><p>Within each of these failure modes, there are sub-classifications, which
    may or may not be important for a particular system.&nbsp; The components of
    a system are the substrate, the coating and the exposure environment.&nbsp;
    Factors affecting the performance of a system include surface preparation,
    coating application, cure regime and film integrity.</p>
    <h4><a name="_Toc478818772">Factors Affecting Blister Initiation</a></h4>
    <SCRIPT>comment(35)</SCRIPT><p>The blistering mechanism of paint coatings upon exposure to aqueous
    environments was addressed by Gay<a name="_Ref477745433">,</a><a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title>[28]</a>
    who found that all the systems examined displayed four common features:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The higher the osmotic pressure of the immersion liquid, the smaller
        the amount of blistering.</li>
      <li>The fluid in blisters formed on seawater immersion is almost
        invariably alkaline and its chloride content is lower than that of the
        seawater.</li>
      <li>The steel under such blisters is usually bright and free from
        corrosion.</li>
      <li>Areas of blistering are frequently associated with adjacent areas of
        corrosion.</li>
    </ol>
    <SCRIPT>comment(36)</SCRIPT><p>In the majority of cases, before any blistering occurred, some corrosion
    was observed at weak points in the coating and no substantial amount of
    blistering was found where corrosion was not present.&nbsp; The suggested
    sequence of events leading to the formation of blisters is as follows.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The paint film imbibes water from the solution, possibly containing
        some dissolved salts.</li>
      <li>Eventually, sufficient liquid containing chloride ions passes through
        to the underlying metal and activates primary corrosion sites at the
        interface.</li>

    Soluble salts at the interface can form a concentrated salt solution that,
    due to decreased water activity, acts to draw water through the coating,
    which behaves as a semi-permeable membrane, from the exposure
    environment.&nbsp; The osmotic pressures exerted can be expected to range
    between 2500 and 3000 kPa compared with a mechanical resistance to
    deformation of a coating ranging from 6 to 40 kPa<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title>[33]</a>&nbsp;
    In addition, the pressure within the blister becomes greater than the
    atmosphere on the free side.<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title>[34]</a>&nbsp;
    So, provided the film is not ruptured in the process, the conditions exist
    for a continually expanding blister.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(41)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 5 schematically represents the stages in the formation of an
    osmotic blister.&nbsp; In Figure 5A a layer of interfacial water in contact

    pressure, produced by the concentration gradient across the coating, has

    <SCRIPT>comment(43)</SCRIPT><p>One suggestion that has been made to reduce the tendency for a coating to
    suffer osmotic blistering hinges on the formulation of the film.&nbsp; In a
    solvent borne coating, it is normal to find that a combination of different
    solvents is employed.&nbsp; According to Storfer and Yuhas, hydrophilic
    solvents can facilitate and accelerate several of the generally recognized
    blister-formation mechanisms, particularly osmotic blistering.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title>[36]</a>&nbsp;
    An inverse relationship was determined between the solubility of water in
    the last solvent in the formulation to evaporate (the tail solvent) and the
    blister resistance of the coating.&nbsp; Hydrophilic solvents are more prone
    to cause blistering.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(44)</SCRIPT><p>This mode of failure was addressed by Koehler,<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title>[37]</a>
    who considered liquid filled blisters to be anodic in nature.&nbsp;
    Experiments were conducted an on epoxy phenolic resin exposed to 0.01N
    calcium chloride.&nbsp; Calcium was chosen as the cation because it does not
    produce an alkaline environment.&nbsp; No deliberate faults or holidays were
    introduced into the coating.&nbsp; The samples were anodically polarised and
    blisters appeared after seven days.&nbsp; The substrate in the centre of the
    blister was dished and corroded while the periphery was bright, indicating
    cathodic detachment.&nbsp; The explanation of these results was that during
    the test, chloride ions passed through the coating at thin points and
    created an acid environment under the coating within the blister.&nbsp; The
    cathodic reaction was postulated as being the reduction of the ferric oxide
    on the steel to the soluble ferrous state.&nbsp; This type of failure
    requires a low pH environment to proceed.&nbsp; Such low values may be found
    in many canned foods and drinks.&nbsp;</p>

    Early work by Kittelberger <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title>[41]</a>
    identified a relationship between bare areas of steel and the occurrence of
    blistering on immersed panels; it was shown that an exposed area of <sub><img src="v3p5_image014.gif" width="33" height="25"></sub>&nbsp;of
    the coated specimen was enough to exert a significant influence on the
    blistering of the coating.&nbsp; Figure 6 shows the proposed failure

    <SCRIPT>comment(46)</SCRIPT><p>The fault may take the form of mechanical damage to the coating or may be
    an inherent fault of the coating i.e. pores or holidays.&nbsp; The primary
    pre-requisite for this form of failure is that the substrate should support
    a cathodic reaction.&nbsp; In the case of a neutral or alkaline environment the cathodic reaction would be the
    reduction of oxygen.&nbsp; Tests with cathodically polarised steel coated

    transmission of water and oxygen through the film was in excess of that
    needed for corrosion and attributed the protective mechanism to the film�s
    high ionic resistance.&nbsp; If we accept this hypothesis, some pathway must
    exist through the film to allow the sodium ions to the interface in order to
    produce the alkaline environment.&nbsp; These pathways could be due to
    pores.&nbsp; However, an alternative theory is proposed by Leidheiser,<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title>[43]</a>

    <SCRIPT>comment(49)</SCRIPT><p>Akin to cathodic blistering, cathodic delamination is also the result of

    cathodic activity under the coating.&nbsp; It is associated with faults,

    consequence of either corrosion at the point of damage or the application of
    cathodic protection.&nbsp; Resulting from experiments carried out by Smith
    and Dickie on primer failure,<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title>[44]</a>
    it has been shown that under impressed cathodic conditions, corrosion
    inhibitive pigments play no part in the reduction of disbonding.&nbsp; Under
    such conditions, the performance of the system reflects the resistance of
    the primer resin system to alkali displacement.&nbsp; During salt spray

    <SCRIPT>comment(50)</SCRIPT><p>A number of explanations have been put forward whereby the alkaline
    environment under the film affects the integrity of the metal - polymer
    interface, or perhaps more properly the interface between the oxide and the
    polymer.&nbsp; Koehler,<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title>[45]</a>
    showed that this form of failure, which he called �halo detachment�,
    only occurs when there are alkali metal cations available in the environment
    to act as counter ions to the cathodically generated OH<sup>-</sup>.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(51)</SCRIPT><p>One explanation is that dissolution of the air-formed oxide layer is
    responsible for the loss of adhesion.&nbsp; Various techniques have been
    adopted to confirm this view.&nbsp; Ritter<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title>[46]</a>
    carried out ellipsometric studies on a range of coatings in tandem with an
    investigation of uncoated steel exposed to saturated NaOH.&nbsp; The
    coatings studied were collodion, polystyrene and two proprietary acrylics,
    all of which were cured at room temperature.&nbsp; Additionally, a
    heat-cured acrylic was examined.&nbsp; The argument put forward was that
    delamination is a direct result of oxide dissolution and this is supported
    by the presence of iron ions in the interfacial region of the polymer in the
    heat cured specimens.&nbsp; The oxide layer present on the metal under these
    circumstances, is thicker than the normal air-formed layer, as a result of
    the curing regime.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(52)</SCRIPT><p>Further work carried out using this technique<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title>[47]</a>
    concluded that the high pH generated under the coating was conducive to
    oxide growth and surface roughening of the substrate.&nbsp; This conclusion
    was the result of tests carried out on uncoated substrates in a high pH
    environment.&nbsp; Taken in conjunction with the findings cited in the
    previous paragraph, the inference of this could be that the thicker oxide
    layer, developed due to the high pH generated under the film, could cause
    the oxide film to become mechanically weaker and result in a cohesive
    failure.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(53)</SCRIPT><p>Castle and Watts,<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title>[48]</a> in an
    XPS investigation of cathodic delamination, concluded that dissolution of
    the oxide layer was not a significant factor in the process.&nbsp; It was
    found that the oxide within the disbonded region was reduced only in
    localised patches and the disbonded area extended well beyond this.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(54)</SCRIPT><p>In a similar vein, Wiggle et al<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title>[49]</a>
    considered different pre-treatments and the effect upon them of cathodically
    produced hydroxide.&nbsp; Both zinc and iron phosphate pre-treatments along
    with bare metal was included in the study.&nbsp; Initial tests were carried
    out to determine the porosity of the conversion coatings, which yielded
    results of 0.2% for the zinc and 23% for the iron phosphate; these porosity
    values were linked to the poor resistance of the iron phosphate to anodic
    undermining.&nbsp; Experiments were carried out under both anodic and
    cathodic polarisation as well as at open circuit.&nbsp; Cathodic
    polarisation trials resulted in dissolution of the zinc phosphate and hence
    loss of adhesion of the coating.&nbsp; Knaster and Parks <a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title>[50]</a>
    also identified dissolution of zinc phosphate under paint coatings on
    pre-treated steel but considered this to be a secondary reaction.&nbsp; The
    contention in this case is that delamination of coatings from phosphated
    panels, due to a defect, is caused by oxygen depolarisation along the
    phosphate-paint interface and hydrogen evolution at the delamination front
    that results in a force, which disrupts the adhesion of the polymer to the
    phosphate layer.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(55)</SCRIPT><p>Dissolution of phosphate conversion coatings on steel was also examined
    by Sommer and Leidheiser.<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title>[51]</a>&nbsp;
    The variables they considered were the effect of the pH and also the alkali
    cation involved.&nbsp; The pH effects were investigated by exposing test
    panels to 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0-M solutions of NaOH for ten minute intervals up
    to one hour.&nbsp; The importance of the cation involved was determined with
    0.1-M solutions of hydroxides of Na, Cs, K and Li.&nbsp; It was found that
    increasing pH values from 11.5 to 13.5 resulted in a higher rate of
    dissolution of the phosphate ions from the conversion coating.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(56)</SCRIPT><p>With regard to the cation type, the investigators were surprised to find
    that Na was the most effective of the cations in the dissolution of the
    coating (1.6, 2.6, &amp; 4.1 times K, Cs &amp; Li respectively).&nbsp;
    Additionally, the cation type not only affected the rate but also the mode
    of dissolution.&nbsp; With Na, Cs and K, the phosphate ions were dissolved
    more rapidly than the zinc ions, whereas in the case of Li, the zinc was the
    one to be dissolved at a higher rate.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(57)</SCRIPT><p>Dissolution of the conversion layer is also suggested by Dickie,<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title>[52]</a>
    after an investigation of the failure of an epoxy coating.&nbsp; This

    delay time observed with alkali resistant coatings.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(58)</SCRIPT><p>An alternative view to the dissolution of the substrate theory is that

    Koehler�s investigation <a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title>[53]</a>
    of oleoresinous and polybutadiene coatings on steel concluded that
    delamination was due to saponification of the polymers.&nbsp; In his
    discussion, he states that disbonding may occur at pH 11.7, which is well
    below that required to dissolve the oxide layer.&nbsp; That higher pH�s
    may form under the coating at cathodic sites is not disputed, however it is
    suggested that this may take place subsequent to the loss of coating
    adhesion.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is proposed that regardless of any other
    phenomena a film of water is required under the coating for disbonding to
    proceed.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(59)</SCRIPT><p>Attack on the polymer is also a mechanism supported by Hammond et al <a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title>[54]</a>
    who examined three different epoxy systems on steel with a coating range of
    10 - 30 �m.&nbsp; In their examination of the interfacial composition of
    delaminated surfaces, using XPS, predominant traces of polymer were in
    evidence on the metal surface relative to iron oxide; this was in
    conjunction with little or no traces of iron in the interfacial
    polymer.&nbsp; Their conclusion from this was that the failure mechanism was
    due to resin degradation and that the locus of failure was within the
    polymer, resulting in a failure that was cohesive in nature.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(60)</SCRIPT><p>Another XPS investigation was undertaken by Castle and Watts <a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title>[55]</a>,
    who looked at fusion-bonded epoxy coated mild steel.&nbsp; The results of

    nature.&nbsp; One of the variables in the experiments carried out was
    surface texture, ranging from grit blasted (R<sub>a</sub> 3.80 �m) to a
    mirror finish polish with 1�m diamond paste (R<sub>a</sub> 0.15 �m).&nbsp;
    It was found that as the R<sub>a</sub> values increased, there was a slight
    tendency toward cohesive failure of the oxide layer.&nbsp; However, although
    some iron was transferred to the polymer, the amount was a trivial component
    of the locus of failure and was consistent with cohesive failure of the
    oxide covering at protruding asperities.&nbsp;</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(61)</SCRIPT><p>The nature of the delamination mechanism is not the only area of debate
    within the overall subject of cathodic delamination.&nbsp; Whilst there is
    agreement as to the species involved in the process, it is still open to
    conjecture how those elements arrive at the delamination front.&nbsp;
    Considering a coated steel substrate, immersed in an electrolyte of neutral
    or near neutral pH, the half-cell reaction responsible for the delamination
    process is generally agreed to be oxygen reduction.&nbsp; This reaction
    generates OH<sup>-</sup> at the cathodic site and is responsible for the
    alkaline environment at the delamination front.&nbsp; The elements required
    for the process to proceed are water, oxygen and free electrons.&nbsp; The
    electrons may be generated by either an anodic reaction or through the
    application of cathodic protection.&nbsp; Additionally, in order to maintain
    electroneutrality, some form of counter ion is required; the high pH values
    recorded at the reaction zone indicate that these counter-ions are alkali
    cations rather than protons<a name="_Ref393638768">.</a><a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title>[56]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(62)</SCRIPT><p>If we assume that cathodic delamination is a result of a damaged coating,
    there are two possible routes that the reactants for the cathodic reaction
    may take.&nbsp; The two alternatives are either through the coating or along
    the polymer-metal interface.&nbsp; An extensive review of the delamination
    process was carried out by Leidheiser et al <a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title>[56]</a>.&nbsp;
    The results of the experiments carried out indicated that water was
    transported to the reaction zone through the coating.&nbsp; It was suggested
    that a certain fraction of this could be in the form of a cation such as H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>,
    as the cathodic nature of the front may favour the transmission of water
    associated with an ion possessing a positive charge.&nbsp; The supply of
    oxygen to the cathodic site was found to be largely through the coating,
    with a small contribution from interfacial transport, in the case of the
    epoxy coating studied.&nbsp; Other work on the subject of the supply of
    reactants to the delamination front with pigmented coatings<a name="_Ref476987668">,</a><a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title>[57]</a>
    suggests that supply of oxygen along the interface may be the
    rate-controlling factor.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(63)</SCRIPT><p>The major unresolved factor in the overall picture is the route taken by
    the charge-neutralising cations.&nbsp; Leidheiser�s study identified a
    linear relationship between the diffusion coefficient in aqueous solutions
    of the different cations, used in his experiments, and the delamination
    rate.&nbsp; This suggested that the cations were supplied along the
    interface.&nbsp; However, as delamination rates showed a strong dependence
    on film thickness,<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title>[58]</a> through
    film migration of cations could not be discounted.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(64)</SCRIPT><p>An important feature identified in Leidheiser�s work was an incubation
    time needed before delamination commenced.&nbsp; This was dubbed the �delay
    time� and the factor controlling this parameter was considered to be
    cation ingress into the coating, due to an observed correlation between
    ionic mobility and the delay time.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(65)</SCRIPT><p>Interfacial migration of cations is supported by the work of Castle and
    Watts<sup>55</sup>.&nbsp; A number of factorsdrew them to this
    conclusion.&nbsp; Firstly, EPMA examination of a cross section of the
    polymer showed Na ingress into the coating from both the interface and the
    bulk solution; however there was no Na detected in the bulk of the polymer,
    suggesting that Na<sup>+</sup> did not fully penetrate the film.&nbsp; Also,
    the disbondment velocity (Dk) was related to the surface profile of the
    substrate and the parameter referred to as tortuosity (<i>&#964;</i>) as

    <SCRIPT>comment(66)</SCRIPT><p>A tortuous interface is one whereby the route that must be taken by a

    difficult by roughening the substrate, thereby making the effective path
    longer.&nbsp; It follows from this that a rougher surface should result in a
    lower lateral degree of delamination, if the controlling mechanism is the
    interfacial migration of a species.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(67)</SCRIPT><p>Castle and Watts� results for a steel/epoxy system produced a constant
    disbondment velocity (<i>Dk</i>*) of 0.4 � 0.08 mm day<sup>-1</sup>.&nbsp;

    experiment, which aimed to clarify the confusion as to the route taken by
    the cationic species, showed a strong linear relationship between the dry

    due to the high pH under the coating.&nbsp; Whilst the second proposition

    Mayne and Mills, were indeed that detached films showed lower resistances,
    as quoted, but not on ordinary mild steel substrates - where the detached
    films showed similar resistances to those attached to the steel.&nbsp; It
    was when the coatings were applied to inert substrates (platinum and steel

    <SCRIPT>comment(72)</SCRIPT><p>Working with both pigmented and unpigmented chlorinated rubber coatings,
    Sharman <a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title>[57]</a> identified a
    number of features worthy of note.&nbsp; Referring to the delay time defined
    by Leidheiser, he concluded for the system under investigation that it was
    essentially independent of cation mobility.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was found
    that the iron oxide pigmented systems showed longer delay times than the
    clear varnish coated substrates; this was unexpected as the former had
    higher ionic permeabilities.&nbsp; This situation was considered by
    pre-soaking the pigmented coatings in water prior to testing; this resulted
    in a reduction in the delay times from 5-7 hours to 1-2 hours.&nbsp; This
    result pointed to ingress of either water or oxygen as the factor
    responsible for the duration of the delay time.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(73)</SCRIPT><p>With regard to the species responsible for the delamination process and
    the route taken, different mechanisms were seen to be responsible for the
    two systems.&nbsp; For the unpigmented coating, interfacial cation migration
    was considered to be the determining factor as the delamination rate
    constant increased in a linear fashion with cation mobility.&nbsp; With the
    pigmented coating, which displayed a greater through-film ionic transport
    rate, coupled with lower oxygen permeability, interfacial migration of
    oxygen was suggested as a likely rate determining mechanism; this was
    suggested to be virtually independent of cation mobility.&nbsp; A further
    result, which reinforced the hypothesis of interfacial migration of a
    species as the rate-determining factor, was that the rate of disbonding
    eventually became zero.&nbsp; The explanation for this was that the
    interfacial pathways became blocked with corrosion products.&nbsp;</p>

    working with unpigmented chlorinated rubber coatings subjected to cathodic
    protection, concluded that the corrosion current passed through faults in
    the form of cracks or crevices in the film. It is proposed that degradation
    of the film due to OH<sup>-</sup> was essentially mechanical in
    nature.&nbsp; This argument is supported by a number of factors.&nbsp; Free
    standing films exhibited conductive behaviour only after long exposure to
    concentrated OH<sup>-</sup>; this was lost after the films were dried in a
    dessicator.&nbsp; It was felt this result supported the hypothesis of
    conduction through cracks or crevices rather than through the bulk
    film.&nbsp; FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra Red) spectra of membranes exposed
    to OH<sup>-</sup> displayed no detectable chemical change from the untreated
    film.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(75)</SCRIPT><p>The underside of the films (that in contact with the metal), which was
    subjected to the alkaline conditions, was found to contain holes that were
    not visible on the upper face of the coating.&nbsp; This is thought to be
    due to pockets of high solvent or plasticiser concentration; it is suggested
    that the OH<sup>-</sup> opens up such defects by a solvent cracking process,
    which reinforces the assertion that the breakdown is mechanical rather than
    chemical.&nbsp;</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(76)</SCRIPT><p>In an ideal world, the coatings that we applied to protect against
    corrosion would be a perfectly homogeneous mix and be free of defects of any
    kind.&nbsp; Also, the surface to which the coatings were applied would be in
    an ideal condition, free of any form of contamination and with an
    appropriate finish.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(77)</SCRIPT><p>This utopian situation does not occur in the real world and the

    adequate preparation of the surface to be coated is either technically
    unfeasible or prohibitively expensive.<a href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title>[62]</a>
    In such circumstances, there is a need for a coating that will perform well
    on a contaminated substrate.&nbsp; Mayne�s<sup>12</sup> model of underfilm
    corrosion, considered earlier, was applicable to a clean surface.&nbsp; In
    the presence of contaminants on the surface, resistance inhibition does not
    come into play, as all the required elements for corrosion to proceed are
    present at the interface.&nbsp;</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(82)</SCRIPT><p>In a search for environmentally acceptable coatings that may be applied

    �surface tolerant coatings�.&nbsp; Frondistou-Yiannas <a href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" title>[73]</a>
    surveyed the range of these coatings and their reported modes of
    action.&nbsp; The mechanisms considered were: conversion of rust to
    magnetite, conversion of iron oxides to other compounds and inertisation of
    soluble salts.&nbsp; In addition to these, Thomas <a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title>[74]</a><sup>
    </sup>also considered barrier coatings, the ability of the coating to wet
    and penetrate the rust and anti-corrosive pigments.&nbsp; The field trials
    of the former investigator, which were carried out in both marine and
    industrial areas, concluded that none of the systems tested was expected to
    provide long-term protection in the aggressive environments used in the
    tests.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(83)</SCRIPT><p>So called rust converters are mainly formulations based upon tannic
    acid.&nbsp; An extensive review of the mechanisms involved in the action of
    tannin based coatings,<a href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77" title>[77]</a>
    details the reaction mechanisms by which it is claimed that tannins help to
    protect steel.&nbsp; The action of tannin-based treatments is explained by
    the inhibition of the formation of magnetite, which if allowed to develop,
    would increase the area available for oxygen reduction.&nbsp; An alternative
    name of �rust deactivators� is proposed for these formulations, which
    may lead one to think that they have some effect upon the contaminants that
    are invariably present.&nbsp; However, this statement is followed by the
    fact that tannins are unable to neutralise surface contaminants such as
    sulphates.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(84)</SCRIPT><p>In her review of rust conversion preparations, Thomas <a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title>[74]</a>
    states that the premise behind their use consists of the stabilisation of
    the rust, so that the redox reaction between Fe(II) and Fe(III) is no longer
    possible.&nbsp; In this case, in principle, corrosion would be
    prevented.&nbsp; It is pointed out, however, that tannic acid reacts with
    Fe(III) within regions underlying thick layers of surface rust; therefore,
    it would be necessary to wire brush the surface prior to treatment.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(85)</SCRIPT><p>A further assessment of the action of tannic acid has been conducted by
    Morcillo et al.<a href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78" title>[78]</a>&nbsp;
    Panels that had been exposed outdoors for up to two years were thoroughly
    wire brushed and immersed in tannic acid of various concentrations.&nbsp;
    Fresh panels were also immersed, to assess the effect on clean steel.&nbsp;
    A film of ferric tannate was found to form on the surface of the rusty
    panels, this film was found to be extremely porous.&nbsp; The results from
    these tests showed that tannic acid promotes rusting on clean steel and does
    not significantly reduce that of rusted steel.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was
    suggested that due to the nature of the ferric tannate film formed on the
    surface, that the tannic acid might attack the iron at the base of the
    pores.</p>

    <SCRIPT>comment(87)</SCRIPT><p>An alternative method of dealing with contaminated surfaces proposed by

      <li>Conversion of salts into safer species.</li>

    therefore the performance, of the system was severely affected by salt
    contamination of the substrate, where the levels were in excess of 2 �g cm<sup>-2</sup>
    when the salts were predominantly chlorides.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(95)</SCRIPT><p>An epoxy coating used as a tank lining was also tested.&nbsp; In this
    case, both the marine and the urban salt contamination resulted in coating
    failure at levels above 20�g cm<sup>-2</sup>.&nbsp; The marine salt,
    however, brought about the failure in 6 days compared with 56 days for the
    urban salt composition.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(96)</SCRIPT><p>The more aggressive nature of the chloride ion is attributed to higher
    osmotic pressures exerted.&nbsp; Additionally, chlorides tend to be more
    soluble than other salts and of a lower formula weight.&nbsp; Hence, a given
    salt burden of a chloride represents a higher molar concentration, which
    produces a higher osmotic pressure.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(97)</SCRIPT><p>As often, in the field of organic coatings, the literature provides what
    appears at first sight, to be contradictory data.&nbsp; The critical
    chloride levels determined by Morcillo <a href="#_edn82" name="_ednref82" title>[82]</a>
    for example was determined to be 50�g cm<sup>-2</sup>.&nbsp; It is
    important that one realises that each different coating/metal system is
    likely to have various parameters, including the chloride levels it can
    tolerate, that are unique to itself.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(98)</SCRIPT><p>Another effect of contaminated surfaces found by Morcillo was the
    degradation of a chlorinated rubber primer applied over contaminated rusted
    steel.<a href="#_edn83" name="_ednref83" title>[83]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    chloride levels found under the films in this investigation were too high to
    be accounted for by the initial contamination or the exposure
    environment.&nbsp; An XPS analysis was carried out which indicated that the
    C-Cl bonds in the polymer underwent a chemical transformation that yielded
    Cl<sup>-</sup> and accounted for the increased chloride concentration in the
    rust at the interface.&nbsp; So the, initially present or subsequently
    formed, interfacial rust appeared to catalyse the decomposition of the
    polymer.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(99)</SCRIPT><p>Morcillo discussed a further aspect of the importance of proper surface
    preparation, in a paper that considered the significance of the size and the
    type of abrasive used during pre-cleaning operations.<a href="#_edn84" name="_ednref84" title>[84]</a>&nbsp;
    One important point highlighted was that there is a critical surface
    profile, the value of which is determined by the environment along with the
    type and thickness of the coating.&nbsp; As the coating increases in
    thickness, the effect of the surface profile diminishes.&nbsp; The critical
    surface profile was found to be a function of the aggressiveness of the
    environment � a more aggressive environment resulted in a lower critical
    profile.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(100)</SCRIPT><p>In conclusion, the surface to be coated is as important a part of the
    overall system as any other, so the state and condition of the substrate
    prior to painting significantly affects the demands that are placed upon the
    coating.&nbsp; Traditionally tried and tested methods for coating
    compromised steel are no longer environmentally acceptable, therefore new,
    safe, ecologically sound alternatives are demanded.&nbsp; Should the
    emerging water-borne paint technology provide a solution to the
    contamination problem, it would also have the added advantage of addressing
    the impending volatile organic content legislation.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc478818783">Adhesion</a></h3>
    <SCRIPT>comment(101)</SCRIPT><p>Within the debate regarding the important features of the protection
    offered by organic coatings, the argument over the importance of adhesion is
    amongst the most contentious.&nbsp; It is often claimed (or at least
    inferred) that the adhesion is of paramount importance, to the exclusion of
    all other features.&nbsp; According to Bullett and Prosser �the ability to
    adhere to the substrate throughout the desired life of the coating is one of
    the basic requirements of a surface coating, second only to the initial need
    to wet the substrate�,<a href="#_edn85" name="_ednref85" title>[85]</a>
    Funke describes adhesion as the most important and decisive property of a
    coating.<a href="#_edn86" name="_ednref86" title>[86]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(102)</SCRIPT><p>In order to enter into the debate as to the importance of adhesion in the
    protective mechanisms of paint systems, it is necessary to consider the
    process of adhesion itself.&nbsp; In particular, the principle of adhesive
    failure needs to be addressed.&nbsp; For two surfaces to adhere to each
    other, be they of the same or of different materials, there is a need for
    intimate contact on an atomic scale between them.&nbsp; In the case of a
    liquid coating, the degree of intimate contact is governed by the ability of
    the coating to wet the substrate.&nbsp; This wetting ability needs to be
    present not only in the static sense, where the contact angle between the
    substrate and the liquid may be used to determine how efficient the wetting
    is; but also in a dynamic sense, where the rate of wetting of the substrate
    is not countered by the rate of shear involved in the application of the
    coating.<a href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87" title>[87]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(103)</SCRIPT><p>According to Bikerman<a href="#_edn88" name="_ednref88" title>[88]</a> a

    <a href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90" title>[90]</a></sup>&nbsp; If one
    subscribes to this point of view, then it must be the case that all failures
    that involve detachment of the coating from the substrate, must include some
    element of either cohesive failure of the coating or the oxide layer on the
    surface of the steel.&nbsp; This view is reinforced by XPS work which has
    been carried out by several workers, who have found that traces of polymeric
    material is normally found on the �metal� surface of a metal/polymer
    interfacial fracture, which may have appeared to be a purely adhesive
    failure from a visual examination.<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title>[54]</a>,
    <a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref54" title>[55]</a>, <a href="#_edn91" name="_ednref91" title>[91]</a>&nbsp;
    Although the explanation of a cohesive polymer or oxide failure may account
    for the observed failure modes, this is probably still an
    oversimplification.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(104)</SCRIPT><p>The function of the adhesive joint is to effectively remove the interface
    from between the two different materials.&nbsp; In order to do this, a
    gradual change must occur in the chemical composition of the coating and the
    substrate in the interfacial area.&nbsp; Plato elucidated this concept in
    his explanation of how the different elements in the universe could exist as
    one:</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(105)</SCRIPT><p>It is not possible for two things to be fairly united without a third for
    they need a bond between them which shall join them both, that as the first
    is to the middle, so is the middle to the last, then since the middle
    becomes the first and the last, and the last and the first become the
    middle, of necessity, all will come to be the same. And being the same with
    one another, all will be a unity.<a href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92" title>[92]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(106)</SCRIPT><p>The inference of this is that in a true adhesive joint, there is no
    clearly defined interface and that one needs to see the interfacial area as
    a gradual transitory phase where the coating and the substrate affect and
    are effected by each other.&nbsp; So, in the same way that the atomic
    structure of the metal gradually changes from that of the bulk phase to that
    of the oxide on the surface � it is proposed that the properties of the
    surface of the uncoated metal are changed when a polymeric coating is
    applied to it.&nbsp; In the same way, Leidheiser suggests that the structure
    of the coating varies as one passes through the bulk of the film to the
    interfacial region with the metal.&nbsp; This region, which extends into the
    polymer, is known as the interphase.&nbsp; The size of the interphase is not
    known, but is thought to be in the nanometer range<a name="_Ref477924448">.</a><a href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93" title>[93]</a>&nbsp;</p>

    immersed or humid environments.<a href="#_edn98" name="_ednref98" title>[98]</a>,
    <a href="#_edn99" name="_ednref99" title>[99]</a> Indeed, it has been
    proposed that, in isolation, adhesion tests are insufficient to determine
    the ability of a coating to control corrosion.<a href="#_edn100" name="_ednref100" title>[100]</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(108)</SCRIPT><p>It is true that the adhesion plays an important role in the protective
    mechanism of coatings, but one should take care when claiming that it is the
    overriding consideration.&nbsp; When one considers the process of cathodic
    delamination it is clear that, once the paint has become detached from the
    substrate, the underlying metal is exposed to the environment and is no
    longer afforded any protection from the coating system.&nbsp; One should,
    however, be careful to ensure that the whole process is viewed in
    context.&nbsp; Whilst the loss of adhesion, resulting from the delamination
    process, effectively negates the protection afforded by the coating, it is
    important to consider whether the original adhesion is the deciding factor
    in the delamination process.&nbsp; Gowers and Scantlebury suggested that the
    beneficial role of the adhesion of a paint coating is due to the impairment
    of the formation of a layer of electrolyte at the coating/substrate
    interface, preventing ionic current flow and the spread of corrosion over
    the surface.<a href="#_edn101" name="_ednref101" title>[101]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(109)</SCRIPT><p>A case in point is that of the use of silanes as adhesion
    promoters.&nbsp; There has been a considerable amount of work carried out in
    this field and the results may, at first sight, appear contradictory.&nbsp;
    The fundamental reason why the results of various investigations lead to
    different conclusions is the starting point and the assumptions made by the
    investigators.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(110)</SCRIPT><p>Some work has been carried out which has shown that the use of silane
    coupling agents leads to an improvement in wet adhesion.<a href="#_edn89" name="_ednref54" title>[89]</a>&nbsp;
    This result has been used to assert that this treatment will therefore
    result in enhanced protection against such phenomena as underfilm corrosion
    or cathodic delamination.&nbsp; This claim is based on the assumption that
    good adhesion to the substrate will necessarily lead to improvement in the
    protection afforded.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(111)</SCRIPT><p>The work of Marsh<a href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102" title>[102]</a> et
    al has tested this assumption and has shown that although silanisation does
    in fact provide better wet adhesion, the treatment afforded no improvement
    in resistance to delamination and that underfilm corrosion was significantly
    worse on the silane treated specimens.&nbsp; It was pointed out by Marsh
    that the use of the cathodic delamination test as a determinant of adhesive
    strength is inappropriate, as the work showed that improved adhesion played
    no part in the rate of delamination.&nbsp; Furthermore, the cathodic
    delamination test is therefore a measure of cationic mobility rather than
    adhesive strength.&nbsp; Other work on salt spray exposure of coated panels
    has found that no adhesion loss had occurred although severe underfilm
    corrosion had taken place.<a href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103" title>[103]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(112)</SCRIPT><p>Good surface preparation is the key to good adhesion but the type, as
    well as the condition, of the substrate has been found to have a strong
    influence upon the initial dry, and the subsequent wet, adhesion of a
    metal/polymer system.&nbsp; Gosselin showed that the metal used as the
    substrate affected the strength of the final dry bond and Arslanov found
    that the adhesive strength of a coating on aluminium initially decreased
    upon exposure to water, but subsequently got stronger.<a href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104" title>[104]</a></p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(113)</SCRIPT><p>One method that has been suggested by Funke to increase the adhesive
    strength of coated systems is the application of thin layer technology.<a href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105" title>[105]</a>,
    <a href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106" title>[106]</a> Here, it is suggested
    that the adhesion to the substrate could be enhanced as a result of
    co-operative bonding between the intermediate thin polymer layer and the
    main bulk of the coating.&nbsp;</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(114)</SCRIPT><p>The proposed thickness of these coatings is in the nanometer range. <a href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107" title>[107]</a>&nbsp;
    While this is in conflict with common coating practice whereby the base
    primer coat is thicker than the surface profile of the metal, when viewed in
    conjunction with Leidheiser�s contention regarding the interfacial region,<a href="#_edn93" name="_ednref54" title>[93]</a>
    and Kumins� model of restricted chain mobility within thin layers;<a href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108" title>[108]</a>
    this may well be an avenue worthy of investigation.</p>
    <SCRIPT>comment(115)</SCRIPT><p>In conclusion, though the adhesion of a coating to the substrate is an
    important factor, which must be taken into consideration when addressing the
    mechanisms of corrosion protection afforded by the coating, the overall
    picture is much more complex and the overall mechanism that must be
    considered is a combination of various contributory factors.&nbsp; Karyakina
    and Kuzmak have produced an extensive overview of the processes of adhesion
    and other contributory factors, together with a review of experimental
    techniques for the evaluation of coating properties.<a href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109" title>[109]</a></p>
