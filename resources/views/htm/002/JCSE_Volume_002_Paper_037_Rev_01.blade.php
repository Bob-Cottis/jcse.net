<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>

  <p>In Part 1 it was shown that aluminium flake pigments decreased cathodic
  disbonding of epoxy coatings significantly. In this article the mechanism of
  the effect of the aluminium pigments is studied. Two possible mechanisms have
  been investigated: a diffusion barrier mechanism and a mechanism where the
  aluminium pigments are chemically active. Water uptake, water diffusion rate,
  oxygen diffusion rate and ionic resistance were measured as a function of
  aluminium content in the paint. Adding 10% aluminium pigments decreased the
  oxygen diffusion rate about six times. However, the oxygen permeability was
  much less affected. The water diffusion rate decreased only slightly. The
  ionic conductivity increased when the aluminium pigment concentration
  increased. It was shown that the aluminium pigments only decrease the rate of
  cathodic disbonding when they are applied in the first coat, directly on the
  steel. The effect was therefore related to their presence at the steel/coating
  interface. This indicates that the aluminium pigments were chemically active
  in decreasing cathodic disbonding, i.e. that they affected the environment on
  the steel/coating interface. It was also shown that the aluminium pigments in
  the disbonded film corroded. The alkaline environment under the disbonded
  coating therefore reached the pigment particles in the coating.</p>

  <h3><a name="_Toc414433468">I</a>ntroduction</h3>
  <p>&sect;3 In Part 1 we reported about the effect of aluminium and glass barrier
  pigments on cathodic disbonding of epoxy coatings. We then found that the
  barrier pigments had a large effect on cathodic disbonding. Epoxy and epoxy
  mastic binders were pigmented with between 0% and 20% (wt.) aluminium
  pigments. Coatings with 10% or more aluminium pigments applied on blast
  cleaned steel had no disbonding after 18 months exposure. After two years of
  testing the coating with 10% aluminium had disbonded about 3 mm. In the same
  test period the coatings without aluminium pigments disbonded 65 mm on
  average. When the coatings were applied on ground steel the disbonding of the
  coating without aluminium was two decades faster than the coating with 10%
  aluminium. The purpose with this paper is to investigate the mechanism for the
  effect of the aluminium pigments on cathodic disbonding.</p>
  <p>&sect;4 A short review of cathodic disbonding and the use of barrier pigments in
  protective paints were given in the previous paper. Cathodic disbonding is
  caused by the formation of a highly alkaline aqueous film under the coating
  [1]. The alkalinity is produced by the cathodic reaction under the coating.
  Under the conditions we have used oxygen reduction is probably the dominating
  cathodic reaction under the coating . In addition to oxygen and water the
  oxygen reaction requires cations to maintain the charge balance at the
  cathode:</p>

  <p>&sect;5 The aluminium pigments are shaped as flakes and tend to orient themselves
  parallel to the substrate. They are therefore expected to improve the barrier
  properties of the coating [2]. The aluminium pigments may have decreased
  cathodic disbonding by decreasing the transport through the coating of either
  of the reactants in Equation 5-1. A barrier mechanism implies that the
  aluminium pigments reduce the transport through the coating of at least one
  reactant, and that this reactant affects the rate of the disbonding. We have
  therefore studied the transport of oxygen, water and ions through an epoxy
  film as function of the concentration of aluminium pigments. The amide cured
  epoxy binder used in the previous paper was used again, with the same
  concentrations of aluminium: 0%, 5%, 10% and 20% by weight in the wet paint.
  The paints are called Epoxy 0, Epoxy 5, Epoxy 10 and Epoxy 20.</p>
  <p>&sect;6 Besides any barrier effects, the aluminium pigments may decrease cathodic
  disbonding by affecting the chemical environment at the steel/coating
  interface. Leidheiser <i>et al.</i> have suggested that aluminium pigments may
  decrease cathodic disbonding by a buffer reaction [1]:</p>

  <p>&sect;7 The reaction will consume hydroxide and may therefore decrease the pH at
  the steel/coating interface. We have tried to verify or disprove this theory.
  However, we have not been able to measure the pH under the coating, which
  would be the most direct test of this theory. If the aluminium pigments
  decrease cathodic disbonding by being chemically active, it must be important
  to apply the aluminium pigmented coat directly on the steel and not in an
  intermediate or topcoat. If the effect of the aluminium pigments is connected
  to their presence at the interface, this will be a strong indication that the
  pigments are chemically active. However, it will not tell whether a buffer
  effect is the mechanism for the reduction in cathodic disbonding.</p>
  <p>&sect;8 If the aluminium oxide on the surface of the pigments is unstable, then the
  aluminium pigments will corrode:</p>

  was then suddenly saturated with air and the current was measured every 15
  minutes. The diffusion coefficient was calculated as a function of the

  <p>&sect;13 Oxygen permeability was measured with a Mocon Ox-Tran 10/50 according to
  ASTM D3985 [6]. The temperature was kept at 23�C, and the relative humidity
  was about 75%. Free films were prepared by applying the paint on Teflon
  sheets. The films were applied in two coats to about 200 �m dry film
  thickness. The first coat was allowed to cure for 24 hours before the second
  coat was applied. After 24 hours, the paint films were gently peeled off the
  Teflon surface. The adhesion was very weak, and the films were still rather
  elastic, so the strain on the paint film was low. We therefore expect that the
  films were insignificantly affected by the preparation.</p>

  <p>&sect;14 Polarisation curves were obtained with the same samples and apparatus as

  <p>&sect;15 Steel samples, 80 x 80 x 5 mm, were cut from mild steel. The samples were
  ground with emery paper to roughness R<sub>y</sub> = 5 �m. The paints were
  applied with an applicator in two coats. The first coat was allowed to cure
  for about 24 hours at room temperature before the second coat was applied.
  Coating thickness was measured with a magnetic gauge. The coatings were given
  a circular damage in the middle of the samples, 6 mm in diameter. Cathodic
  disbonding was tested in substitute seawater [3] at room temperature. The
  samples were polarised to -1050 mV SCE by a potentiostat. The disbonded
  diameter was measured in four directions, and the disbonded area was
  calculated from the average diameter.</p>
  <h4><a name="_Toc414433474">TEM Analysis of the Aluminium Pigments</a></h4>
  <p>&sect;16 Epoxy 10 was applied on ground steel plates in two coats with a total dry
  film thickness of 200 �m. The samples were exposed in substitute seawater at
  25�C, and polarised to -1050 mV SCE by a potentiostat. The panels were
  exposed until the disbonding front had moved about 10 mm from the initial
  holiday in the coating. TEM samples were prepared by ultramicrotomy [7]. Cross
  sections of the disbonded film were embedded in epoxy. Ultrathin slices of the
  cross sections were cut with a diamond knife and investigated in TEM. Element
  composition of the aluminium pigments was investigated by Energy Dispersive
  X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS).</p>

  <p>&sect;19 All results are averages of three parallels, except oxygen permeability
  where only two parallels were tested. The deviation between the parallels for
  the oxygen permeability was less than the uncertainty in the instrument, which
  was 4%.</p>
  <p>&sect;20 The water uptake was between 3.2 vol% and 3.8 vol% for the four coatings
  (i.e. the water concentration was between 1.8 and 2.1 mol/l). Epoxy 0, Epoxy 5
  and Epoxy 10 had the same water uptake. The difference between Epoxy 20 and
  the others was statistically significant on the 2.5% significance level (i.e.
  97.5% possibility for the conclusion to be true). The water uptake was
  therefore relatively little affected by the aluminium pigments. The water
  diffusion coefficients were calculated from the desorption rates, as described
  in the experimental section. Figure 2 shows the water desorption plotted
  according to Equation 5.5. The approximately straight lines obtained at short
  times in the diagram show that the desorption followed Fick's law and that
  Equation 5-5 can be used. The water diffusion coefficients depended on the
  water concentration in the film. The water diffusion coefficients in Table 1
  were calculated from the short time desorption (the first 8 hours after
  exposure), when the water concentration in the film was high. This is most
  relevant for a submerged paint film, which is saturated with water. The
  difference between Epoxy 0 and Epoxy 5 is statistically significant on the 5%
  level. The difference between Epoxy 10 and Epoxy 20 is also statistically
  significant on the 5% level.</p>

  <p>&sect;22 The oxygen diffusion coefficient decreased when the aluminium content
  increased, as predicted by the barrier mechanism theory. Table 1 shows that
  the oxygen diffusion coefficient was about six times lower for Epoxy 10 than
  for Epoxy 0. The decrease was statistically significant on the 1% level.
  Increasing the aluminium concentration above 10% did not seem to have any
  effect on the oxygen diffusion coefficient. Figure 3 shows the current
  transient on three samples of Epoxy 5 after suddenly saturating the
  electrolyte with air. The break-through time in Equation 5-6 was found by
  extrapolating the linear part of the initial raising current to its crossing
  with the current level at the start. The break-through time is indicated for
  one of the samples in the figure.</p>
  <p>&sect;23 The rate of oxygen transport depends on both the diffusion coefficient and
  the oxygen solubility in the film. The permeability coefficient includes the
  effect of the solubility and is therefore probably a better measure for the
  effect of aluminium on the oxygen transport. The aluminium pigments affected
  the permeability coefficient much less than the diffusion coefficient. Epoxy 0
  and Epoxy 10 differed by a factor less than two. The aluminium pigments
  therefore seems to have increased the solubility of oxygen in the film
  significantly. Thomas has earlier reported that the oxygen permeability of an
  amide cured epoxy resin was about 130&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;100 �m (m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;day&nbsp;atm)<sup>-1</sup>
  [8]. Converted to this unit, Epoxy 0 had a permeability of 98&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;100
  �m (m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;day&nbsp;atm)<sup>-1</sup>. The permeability
  coefficients we have found therefore seem reasonable.</p>

  <p>&sect;25 Figure 4 shows the polarisation curves of the painted samples. The
  relationship between the current and the polarisation potential was linear.
  The effect of the external polarisation on the potential of the steel under
  the coating must therefore have been very small. Hence, the cathodic current
  was entirely limited by the resistance in the paint film [9]. The calculated
  resistivities are given in Table 2. The resistivity of the coatings decreased
  with increasing aluminium content. This probably means that the pigments
  introduce new pathways for transport of ions through the coating. There are
  several possible explanations for this. The curing of the binder around the
  pigments may be incomplete if the pigments inhibit diffusion of the curing
  agent. The pigments may also be surrounded by water filled voids with high
  conductivity. The decrease in the resistivity is large. The resistivity of
  Epoxy 0 and Epoxy 20 differed by more than two decades.</p>

  <h4><a name="_Toc414433477">Transport Properties Compared to Cathodic
  Disbonding</a></h4>
  <p>&sect;29 A barrier mechanism for the effect of aluminium pigments on cathodic
  disbonding implies that the pigments decrease the transport of at least one of
  the reactants, and that this reactant affects the rate of disbonding. The rate
  of cathodic disbonding should then correlate with the transport rate of this
  species. Figure 5 shows the transport properties and disbonding rate for the
  films as function of aluminium pigment concentration. The disbonding rates are
  taken from the disbonding experiments on ground steel substrate in Part 1. The
  responses are normalised to the results for Epoxy 0.</p>

  properties as function of aluminium pigment concentration. The responses are

  <p>&sect;31 Figure 5 shows that the decrease in water diffusivity, oxygen diffusivity
  and oxygen permeability was relatively small compared to the effect of
  aluminium on cathodic disbonding. The transport of charge through the film
  increased with increasing aluminium content, i.e. opposite to the effect of
  the pigments on cathodic disbonding. Neither of the transport parameters
  correlates well with the disbonding rate. This indicates that the mechanism of
  the effect of the aluminium pigments on cathodic disbonding is something else
  than the barrier effect.</p>
  <h4><a name="_Toc414433478">Active Aluminium Pigments</a></h4>
  <p>&sect;32 The aluminium pigments are covered with oxide. According to the supplier
  the pigments contain 1-3% aluminium oxide. Leidheiser <i>et al</i>. have
  suggested that the oxide on the pigments may act as a buffer that decreases
  the pH beneath the film [1]. Hydroxide generated by the cathodic reaction at
  the steel/coating interface is generally accepted as being responsible for
  cathodic disbonding, as discussed in the introduction in Part 1. If hydroxide
  is removed from the steel/coating interface by buffering reactions with the
  coating, disbonding may also decrease. According to the Pourbaix-diagram for
  aluminium [10], solid aluminium oxide is not stable above pH 9-10 and will
  react with hydroxide (Equation 5-2). A simple experiment was performed to test
  the buffer theory. Epoxy 0 and Epoxy 10 were applied in two-coat films in the
  four possible combinations of the two paints. The application and coating
  thickness is illustrated in Figure 6. If there is a buffer effect from the
  aluminium pigments, it will be important to have the aluminium pigments in the
  first coat. Then only system 3 and 4 will show decreased cathodic disbonding.
  If the effect of the aluminium pigments on cathodic disbonding is a general
  barrier effect, then system 4 will perform best, system 2 and 3 will perform
  equally and system 1 will perform worst. The disbonding rates are given in
  Figure 7.</p>

  films with and without aluminium pigments applied on top of each other. Test
  conditions: Substitute seawater, -1050 mV SCE, 25�C, 4 parallels.</b></p>
  <p>&sect;35 Figure 7 shows that the disbonding rate was low and almost the same for
  system 3 and 4. System 1 and 2 also had nearly the same disbonding rate, but
  much higher than system 3 and 4. This experiment clearly demonstrates the
  importance of applying the aluminium pigmented coat directly on the steel
  substrate. This also favours the buffer theory over the barrier theory. System
  2 and 3 should have the same barrier properties, but the disbonding of system
  3 is much slower than for system 2. In addition system 2, which should have
  been a better barrier, has only slightly less disbonding than system 1. The
  same is the case with system 3 compared to system 4. These results demonstrate
  that the positive effect of the aluminium pigments is linked to their presence
  at the steel/coating interface.</p>
  <h4><a name="_Toc414433479">Corrosion of the Aluminium Pigments</a></h4>
  <p>&sect;36 Aluminium is not passive in aqueous solutions with pH above 9-10, and will
  corrode according to Reaction 5-3. Ritter <i>et al.</i>[11]<i> </i>and McLeod
  <i>et al.</i>[12]<i> </i>have found that the pH under the disbonded film can
  be as high as 14. We can then ask whether the aluminium pigments will corrode
  or be protected by the binder. If the pigments corrode they may gradually
  disappear and leave large voids in the film. The corrosion of the pigments may
  also have a positive effect on e.g. cathodic disbonding. Both oxygen and
  hydroxide are consumed in the corrosion reaction, which may decrease the
  disbonding rate. The buffer theory for the reduction in cathodic disbonding
  presented above presupposes that the sodium hydroxide under the coating has
  access to the pigments. If we can verify that the pigments corrode, it will
  also support the buffer theory.</p>
  <p>&sect;37 Figure 8 shows a micrograph of a cross section of Epoxy 10 after cathodic
  disbonding. The coating was 360 �m thick and the sample had been exposed for
  three months in substitute seawater at 25�C, polarised to -1050 mV SCE with a
  potentiostat. The disbonding propagated along the cross section, and the
  disbonded distance was about 10 mm. The section of the film shown in Figure 8
  is about 3 mm, and the disbonding front is to the right. The dark area in the
  cross section is filled with metallic aluminium flakes, while in the bright
  areas the aluminium pigments have corroded and are converted to aluminium
  oxide. In the left end of the section, the film has probably been disbonded
  for several weeks. Here the aluminium pigments have corroded into about 1/4 of
  the film thickness. Towards the disbonding front at right end of the picture,
  the corrosion of the pigments is less severe. Near the front, the bright area
  is only a thin line. Here the film has disbonded recently and only the
  pigments close to the interface have had time to corrode. Cross sections of
  Epoxy 10 outside the disbonded region (adhering coating), taken after two
  years exposure in the long term test in Part 1, showed no sign of pigment
  corrosion. The corrosion of pigments deep inside the film therefore seems to
  take place mainly after the coating has disbonded. Under an intact and
  adhering film, the cathodic reaction is probably too slow to give significant
  corrosion of the aluminium pigments.</p>

  Epoxy 10 after disbonding.</b></p>
  <p>&sect;39 We also prepared thin cross sections of the disbonded film by
  ultramicrotomy and analysed the pigments by TEM as described in the
  experimental section. Figure 9 shows micrographs of pigments taken at two
  positions in the film indicated below the pictures. The pigments shown in
  Figure 9A was found near the steel surface, less than 1 mm from the disbonding
  front. The picture shows several pigments located in a cluster. The pigments
  consist of a crystalline structure, which due to the different grain
  orientations leads to the varying contrast. Analysis of the electron
  diffraction pattern together with the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
  (EDS) seen in Figure 10A shows that the pigments consist of aluminium only.
  The Small aluminium oxide contribution seen in Figure 10A is due to oxidation
  of the TEM sample after preparation.</p>
  <p>&sect;40 Figure 9B shows a cross section of two pigments near the steel surface, but
  about 5 mm from the disbonding front. Pigment 1, found on the left in the
  picture, has only corroded slightly and aluminium oxide is only found on the
  surface. Pigment 2, in the centre of the picture, is completely corroded.
  Electron diffraction pattern analysis together with EDS analysis shown in
  Figure 10B confirmed that this structure was amorphous and consisted primarily
  of aluminium oxide. The excess of oxygen is due to crystal water in the oxide.
  This crystal water started evaporating during the electron beam irradiation,
  forming the cellular structure seen in pigment 2.</p>
  <p>&sect;41 This shows that the electrolyte under the coating had access to the
  pigments in the film. The corrosion of the pigments will consume hydroxide
  formed in the cathodic reaction at the steel/coating interface. The corrosion
  of the pigments is therefore another strong indication for that the aluminium
  pigments reduce cathodic disbonding by a buffer mechanism.</p>

  <h3><a name="_Toc414433480">C</a>onclusion</h3>
  <p>&sect;44 In a previous article we have shown that aluminium pigments decrease the
  rate of cathodic disbonding for two different epoxy binders. In this article
  we have investigated two possibilities for mechanism behind the effect: A
  barrier mechanism and a mechanism where the aluminium pigments are chemically
  active.</p>
  <p>&sect;45 The aluminium pigments decreased the oxygen diffusion rate through the
  epoxy coating. However, the oxygen permeability coefficient was much less
  affected. The transport of water was only slightly affected by the aluminium
  pigments. The ionic conductivity of the epoxy increased when the aluminium
  pigment concentration increased.</p>
  <p>&sect;46 The aluminium pigments had insignificant effect on cathodic disbonding
  unless the aluminium containing film was applied directly on the steel
  surface. The effect was therefore connected to their presence near the
  steel/coating interface. This indicates that the aluminium pigments had an
  additional effect on cathodic disbonding besides any barrier effects. Others
  have suggested that buffering reactions with the oxide on the surface of the
  pigments may decrease cathodic disbonding. We have also shown that the
  aluminium pigments in the disbonded film corroded after cathodic disbonding.
  The alkaline environment under the disbonded coating therefore had access to
  the pigment particles in the coating.</p>
