<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>
  <p>Trials have been conducted of four types of waterborne paints on various
  ferrous substrates. Samples were subjected to either a Scab test for two
  years, or ten days of salt spray testing.</p>
  <p>&sect;2 Interestingly, the acrylic paints all performed worse on galvanized steel
  than on carbon steel. This contradicts previous experience of waterborne
  acrylics at the Swedish Corrosion Institute and elsewhere. It was not
  possible, using grazing-angle FTIR, to establish what had happened; infrared
  results seem to indicate that an alkali environment is necessary to the
  degradation of the coatings; but the role which the zinc plays is not clearly
  defined.</p>
  <p>&sect;3 The conclusion drawn is not that waterborne acrylic coatings are unsuitable
  for galvanized substrates, but that further work is necessary to understand
  the interactions of zinc and waterborne acrylic polymers. Theories for why the
  zinc caused this include:</p>
  <p>&sect;4 Either the initial adhesion to the zinc was poor (a polymer composition
  problem) or the zinc substrate was not wetted (a paint formulation problem).
  In either case, water and oxygen can reach the zinc surface and initiate
  corrosion of the zinc. This causes an alkali environment at the zinc-paint
  interface, causing saponification of the polymer.</p>
  <p>&sect;5 The zinc is causing further crosslinking of the binder, depending on which
  monomers are used. Crosslinking goes too far and the coating becomes brittle.
  Weathering stresses such as temperature change and wetting/drying cycles break
  down the cured coating.</p>
  <p>&sect;6 Zn<sup>++</sup> ions destroyed the coulombic stability of the dispersion,
  leading to flocculation. The paint is in effect destroyed after being applied
  but before a coherent film can form.</p>
  <p>&sect;7 Zinc ions, together with organic acids in the paint (from additives, rather
  than the binder), form a zinc soap which in turn breaks down the cured paint.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>&sect;9 Waterborne paints are not simply solventborne paints in which the organic
  solvent has been replaced with water; the paint chemist must design an
  entirely new system from the ground up. Additives to keep the pigment from
  clumping, for example, may be completely different for a dispersion in a polar
  liquid such as water than in a nonpolar organic solvent. The same can be said
  for the chemicals added to make the pigments integrate with the binder, so
  that pigment particles are not simply occupying voids in the binder. The
  binder itself most frequently exists as a dispersion in waterborne paints. To
  keep the solid polymer in a stable and even dispersion, rather than in clumps
  at the bottom of the paint can, requires some creative use of additives. And
  of course, additives may be used to prevent flash rusting of the steel before
  enough water has evaporated for the polymer to form a coherent film which can
  provide corrosion protection.</p>
  <p>&sect;10 The implications of all this paint chemistry for coating-substrate
  interactions, and hence coating-substrate compatibility, is not well known.
  The subject is of more than academic interest: experience from the field shows
  that waterborne acrylic paints on galvanized surfaces sometimes perform
  extremely well &#150; but sometimes degrade quickly, for unknown reasons.</p>
  <p>&sect;11 The aim of this project was to examine the compatibility of various ferrous
  substrates with acrylic waterborne resins. Four different paints were studied.</p>
  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  <h4>Paints:</h4>
  <p>&sect;12 Four acrylic paint systems (one from each of four manufacturers, to obtain
  a representative collection) were used in this study. Each manufacturer also
  provided a waterborne epoxy paint. The ranking of the four substrates were
  fairly well known for the epoxies; they were therefore used as a control of
  overall surface preparation.</p>
  <p>&sect;13 All the coatings are lead-free and chromate-free. The 36 substrate-coating
  combinations studied are summarized in Table 1, wherein K, L, M and N
  represent the four coatings manufacturers.</p>

  <h4>Substrates</h4>
  <p>&sect;15 Four substrates were included in this study: hot-rolled steel,
  blast-cleaned to Sa 2�, surface profile medium; hot-dipped galvanized steel,
  lightly blasted; zinc-phosphated cold-rolled steel; and Aluzink-coated. Zinc
  thickness' on the hot-dipped galvanized samples ranged from 68 to 77 microns;
  the average zinc thickness was 72 microns.</p>
  <h4>Initial Adhesion</h4>
  <p>&sect;16 The initial adhesion of the newly-cured coatings to the substrates were
  tested using the method ISO-2409, &quot;Paints and varnishes - cross-cut
  test&quot; [1]. In this test, six parallel cuts spaced 1 mm apart are scribed
  through the paint to bare metal. Then six more parallel cuts, also spaced 1 mm
  apart, are made perpendicular to the first set of cuts; a 5-by-5 grid is thus
  made. The panel is brushed along both diagonals of the enscribed squares. The
  amount of paint removed by this procedure is classified according to Table 2
  below.</p>

  <h4>Scab Test:</h4>
  <p>&sect;18 A weakly-accelerated field test known as the &#145;SCAB-test&#146;, Swedish
  Standard SS 117211, was performed on the scribed samples. Prior to testing,
  samples were scribed down to the steel by cutting through the paint with a
  hand-held 1-mm wide stainless steel blade held against a steel ruler. The
  resultant scribe is 1 mm in width, oriented horizontally and symmetrically
  located, on each sample. In the SCAB-test, samples are set out at an outdoor
  exposure station at SCI&#146;s facilities in Stockholm, and sprayed twice-weekly
  with a 3% NaCl solution. Samples were placed 45<font face="Symbol">�</font>
  from the vertical, facing west, with the scribe horizontal. Testing was begun
  in July 1995 and ended in July 1997. After the field exposure was completed,
  samples were evaluated for maximum one-way creep from scribe, blistering,
  cracking, flaking, and rust intensity.</p>
  <h4>Salt Spray:</h4>
  <p>&sect;19 The salt spray test, ASTM B-117, was <u>not</u> performed in order to rank
  the coatings or provide any sort of comparison of the coating-substrate
  combinations used in this study. Rather, it was performed in order to see if
  exposure to a different corrosion environment - with constant wetness instead
  of cycling - would provide any additional clues interactions between
  substrates and polymers.</p>
  <p>&sect;20 Samples scribed as described previously were run in the salt spray test for
  ten days. The test was carried out in accordance with ASTM B-117; scribes were
  placed parallel to the ground. At the end of ten days, samples were evaluated
  for maximum one-way creep from scribe, blistering, cracking, flaking, and rust
  intensity.</p>
  <h4>Grazing-Angle Ftir:</h4>
  <p>&sect;21 FT-IR studies were performed to look for evidence of saponification. Two
  methods were used, the KBr (Potassium Bromide)-pellet method and the ATR
  (Attenuated Total Reflectance) method. The KBr-pellet method was used to
  analyse corrosion products and the ATR method was used to analyse the paint
  surface. For the KBr-pellet studies, the apparatus was a Biorad FTS-175C and
  for the ATR studies the apparatus was an UMA500 FT-IR microscope with an ATR
  objective.</p>

  <p>&sect;24 An analysis of variance (general linear model) was performed on this data,
  with adhesion as response and binder type (epoxy, acrylic, etc.), manufacturer
  (K-N), substrate (hot-rolled steel, phosphated etc.), and coating thickness as
  factors. The results are summarized in Table 4 below. &#145;DF&#146;, &#145;Seq. SS&#146;,
  and &#145;Adj. SS&#146; refer respectively to degrees of freedom, sequential sums of
  squares, and adjusted sums of squares. It can be seen, from the large F-values
  and low p-values (where a p-value below 0.05 indicates that the factor may be
  considered significant), that binder type and paint composition are both
  significant in determining initial adhesion; substrate is not important for
  the four ferrous substrates used in this study, and neither is coating
  thickness <i>for the number of datapoints included here</i>.</p>

  <p>&sect;32 <b><u>Behavior of the acrylics:</b></u> The results for acrylics were quite
  surprising. Whereas the acrylics as a group experience creep from scribe and
  edge corrosion on blast-cleaned hot-rolled steel, the same paints degrade
  completely and flake off of the hot-dipped galvanized substrates. This is a
  complete reverse of what had been expected, and indeed does not agree with
  results from other trials [2].</p>
  
  <p>&sect;33 <b><u>Are acrylics vulnerable to saponification?</b></u> A possible clue is found
  in the Swedish pulp and paper industry standard SSG 1009, &quot;Systems for
  initial painting of hot dip zinc coated steel&quot; [3], which advises that
  zinc-coated surfaces should be painted with paints based on non-saponifiable
  binders. What is of interest here is that zinc-coated surfaces, either
  initially or as they undergo corrosion, can be expected to provide an alkali
  environment. The question then becomes, are acrylics vulnerable to
  saponification?</p>
  <p>&sect;34 Acrylics can be divided into two groups, acrylates (or polyacrylates) and
  methacrylates, depending upon the original monomer from which the polymer was
  built. (The difference lies in a methyl group attached to the backbone of the
  polymer molecule of a methacrylate in place of the hydrogen atom found in the
  acrylate.)</p>
  <p>&sect;35 Billmeyer, in his classic text on polymer science, states that methyl
  methacrylates are quite resistant to saponification -&#150;but that polyacrylates
  are not [4]. If an acrylic paint, therefore, is composed entirely of methyl
  methacrylate, it should not saponify. If, however, it is a polyacrylate or
  mixture of the two types, it may be vulnerable to saponification.</p>
  <p>&sect;36 In practice, it is not feasible to formulate a coating entirely upon methyl
  methacrylate. Certain mechanical properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) and
  polyacrylates, given in Table 9 below, indicate that methyl methacrylate needs
  some modification from a copolymer in order to form a satisfactory paint:
  while the high tensile strength has good implications for impact resistance,
  for example, the elongation of pure methyl methacrylate is undesirably low.
  High amounts of external plastisizers or coalescing solvents would be required
  to form a film at room temperature. The excellent mechanical properties of
  methyl methacrylate mean that a waterborne paint based solely on this polymer
  would have a minimum film formation temperature of over 100�C ! [8]</p>

  <p>&sect;38 A &#145;softer&#146; acrylate used as a copolymer could improve the ability of
  the binder to flex and bend to some extent, which is desirable in a coating
  for cold crack resistance [6] or dimensionally active substrates such as wood
  [4].</p>
  <p>&sect;39 It seems reasonable to postulate that the binder in the acrylic paints is
  not composed entirely of methyl methacrylate, but of at least a copolymer; and
  that the particular binders used in this study saponified in the presence of
  zinc.</p>
  <p>&sect;40 However, this should not lead to the conclusion that all acrylic emulsion
  polymers on the market saponify, unless they are pure methacrylates. Other
  compositional variations, like the type of acrylate monomer used for
  co-polymerization, the polymer morphology, the molecular weight and the
  methods used to stabilize the emulsion in water are of major importance. And
  in fact all the paint ingredients, not merely the binder, must be carefully
  selected in order to achieve good performance on zinc.</p>
  
  <p>&sect;41 <b><u>What role does the zinc play?</b></u> The four waterborne acrylic paint
  systems showed markedly worse performance on galvanized steel than on carbon
  steel; the trend was just the opposite for the four epoxies (as expected).
  Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that these results are not due to
  some mistake in preparing the galvanized samples which resulted in an entirely
  unpaintable surface. It also seems reasonable to conclude that no drastic
  mistakes in application of the acrylics were made, since these paints showed a
  normal behavior on the other ferrous substrates. The degradation of the
  acrylics on the galvanized steel seems, therefore, to be due to an interaction
  between the zinc and the acrylic coatings.</p>
  <p>&sect;42 As discussed above, it is quite possible that the copolymers used in this
  study underwent saponification and failed. But what role, precisely, did the
  zinc play in this? There are several possiblities:</p>
  <p>&sect;43 The initial adhesion to the zinc was poor. The polymer compositions used
  for these coatings were not optimized for zinc, but rather for carbon steel.
  The reactive groups on the polymers which are intended to adhere to the
  substrate, did not react well enough with zinc. The zinc does not receive
  sufficient corrosion protection from the coating; water and oxygen can reach
  the zinc surface and initiate corrosion of the zinc. This corrosion causes an
  alkali environment at the zinc-paint interface, causing saponification of the
  polymer.</p>
  <p>&sect;44 The zinc substrate was not wetted, due to paint formulation rather than
  polymer design. The reactive groups on the polymer may be ideally suited to
  adhere to zinc; but if the paint does not flow &#150; e.g., due to high viscosity
  &#150; enough across zinc to wet the substrate surface, the polymer never has a
  chance to adhere tightly. As in the previous case, water and oxygen can reach
  the zinc surface and initiate corrosion of the zinc. This causes an alkali
  environment at the zinc-paint interface, causing saponification of the
  polymer.</p>
  <p>&sect;45 The zinc causes further crosslinking of the binder during cure, depending
  on which monomers are used. Crosslinking goes too far and the coating becomes
  brittle. Weathering stresses such as temperature change and wetting/drying
  cycles break down the cured coating. Saponification is not the major mechanism
  of degradation in this theory.</p>
  <p>&sect;46 Zn<sup>++</sup> ions destroyed the coulombic stability of the dispersion,
  leading to flocculation. The paint is in effect destroyed after being applied
  but before a coherent film can form.</p>
  <p>&sect;47 Zinc ions, together with organic acids in the paint (from additives, rather
  than the binder), form a zinc soap which in turn breaks down the cured paint.
  The formation of metal soaps by the reaction of metal compounds with organic
  acids is a well known phenomenon. It is known, for example, that this is the
  mechanism by which red-lead paint protects steel. The acids may be present in
  these paints already at its production, due to additives used rather than the
  binder. Different metal soaps have, however, different properties. The lead
  soaps formed in red lead paints based on linseed oil are known to be elastic,
  adhering and very resistant to water. Zinc soaps, in contrast to lead soaps,
  are known to be brittle and to be water soluble [7]; the latter can be
  expected to increase the driving force for the water transport through the
  paint film towards the metal surface.</p>
  
  <p>&sect;48 <b><u>Has evidence of saponification been observed?</b></u> Grazing-angle FTIR
  studies were performed on the samples which had been exposed at the outdoor
  station for two years, and on the samples which had been in the salt spray
  test for ten days. The paint surface which had been immediately adjacent to
  the metal was examined for evidence of zinc soaps. The problem with this
  technique was that to examine the paint at this interface, it was necessary to
  look at areas where delamination had occurred; and since delamination was
  always associated with corrosion of the underlying substrate in these samples,
  these were areas heavily contaminated with corrosion products. The only
  identifiable spectra observed, were those attributable to the corrosion
  products Zn<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>2<font face="Symbol">�</font> </sub>H<sub>2</sub>O
  and ZnO. An interesting peak was seen on all the samples at 1385cm<sup>-1</sup>.
  Paints all have a peak here, but for these samples it was sharper than normal.</p>
  <p>&sect;49 Samples with only the primer of the system which had shown the most
  degradation, Acrylic K, were studied with the FTIR before and after exposure
  to solutions containing ZnCl, and NaOH. A solution of ZnCl in distilled water
  (pH 5 after addition of ZnCl) was used; the other solution was sodium
  hydroxide in water, with pH 11. A solution of zinc ions in an <u>alkali </u>solution
  would have been of interest, of course, but was not possible; at alkali
  conditions the zinc precipitates out of solution and the pH drops sharply.
  After 1340 hours of exposure to the ZnCl solution, no change was seen in the
  FTIR spectra of the Acrylic K primer. The sample of Acrylic K primer which was
  exposed to NaOH at pH 11, on the other hand, showed a change in peaks at
  1380cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1029cm<sup>-1</sup>. After 113 hours' exposure to the
  alkali solution, these peaks had had increased height in comparison to the
  other peaks. After 1340 hours' exposure to the solution, both the height and
  width were acccentuated. The conclusion seems to be that the mere presence of
  zinc is not enough to affect the <i>cured</i> coating; an alkali environment
  is needed.</p>
  <p>&sect;50 The salt spray results hint that zinc, or corrosion products, or both, are
  responsible for the acrylics' degradation. The pattern of blistering seen on
  the acrylics after 10 days&#146; salt spray testing is quite different from that
  seen after two years&#146; SCAB exposure. After the salt spray testing, blisters
  are dramatically concentrated under the scribe, and seem to follow the lines
  of the liquid running down from the scribe. Because of the constant wetness in
  the salt spray chamber, the zinc in galvanized or galvalume coatings undergoes
  a different corrosion mechanism from that which would occur in a field
  exposure; the zinc rapidly dissolves without forming corrosion products in the
  salt spray chamber.<sup> </sup>Thus the runoff liquid under the scribe may be
  expected to contain zinc, and alkaline corrosion products, from the inorganic
  coating exposed at the scribe. It is not known whether the blistering seen in
  the runoff lines under the scribe is due to a reaction in these areas between
  the paint and the zinc in the runoff liquid, or between the paint and the
  alkaline zinc corrosion products.</p>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <p>&sect;51 Waterborne acrylic coatings are frequently used on galvanized substrates
  with good results; however, the acrylic coatings used here performed much
  worse on galvanized steel than on carbon steel. A possible explanation is that
  the copolymers used for the binder were vulnerable to saponification.</p>
  <p>&sect;52 More work should be done in this area to identify more clearly the
  processes by which these acrylics degrade on the zinc surfaces. Evidence
  confirming or eliminating saponification as the cause of acrylic degradation,
  the actual mechanism of degradation (zinc surface producing an alkali
  environment leading to saponification, or zinc plus binder creating zinc
  soaps, et cetera), and which acrylic polymer chemistries and pretreatments
  before painting lead to a tendency to this, are areas which could benefit from
  future research.</p>
