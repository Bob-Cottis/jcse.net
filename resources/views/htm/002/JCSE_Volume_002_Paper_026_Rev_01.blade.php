<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>
  <p>The alkaline nature of the environment at the paint/metal interface has
  been addressed.&nbsp; A pH indicator has been incorporated into an alkyd
  coating and the alkalinity of the environment at the interface monitored as a
  function of time using time lapse photography.</p>
  <p>&sect;2 <b>Keywords:</b> Blistering, Delamination, Alkyd, Marine Environment.
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>&sect;3 When a coating is exposed to an aggressive medium, such as that found in a
  marine environment, the associated failure mechanisms of blistering and
  delamination are amongst the most important to be considered.&nbsp; These two
  modes of failure are often treated separately, but have so many common
  features that it could be argued that the differences are a matter of degree
  rather than type.&nbsp; There is a general consensus over the integrity of a
  typical coating and it is fair to assume that one will find defects, due to
  porosity or damage in service.&nbsp; Therefore the following considers the
  situation of an organically coated steel structure containing a defect, which
  is subjected to aggressive, immersed conditions.</p>
  <p>&sect;4 Due to the presence of imperfections in the coating, the steel substrate is
  directly exposed to its surroundings.&nbsp; This initiates a corrosion
  process, with the anodic reaction occurring at the defect, this reaction
  follows that shown in equation (1)</p>

  <p>&sect;5 In order to maintain electroneutrality within the system, this reaction is
  balanced by a cathodic reaction.&nbsp; In most naturally occurring situations,
  this reaction will be oxygen reduction, as illustrated in equation (2).&nbsp;
  These two reactions initially take place adjacent to each other but separate
  as the process continues with the cathode moving under the coating.</p>

  <p>&sect;6 The ferrous ions produced in equation (1) go into solution and react to
  produce electrically neutral compounds through combination with cations in the
  medium.&nbsp; This leaves us with a charge imbalance.&nbsp; The environment
  has a surfeit of positive charge, in the form of whatever cations are present
  and the environment at the cathode is producing hydroxyl ions, resulting in an
  excess of negative charge.&nbsp; In the case of uncoated steel, the route for
  the counter-cations is straightforward.&nbsp; However, when the steel is
  coated the situation becomes more complicated.&nbsp; The path from the
  exposure environment to the cathodic site is either restricted or blocked
  completely.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;7 It was shown by Mayne [1] that coatings were so permeable to water and
  oxygen that their rate of arrival at the cathodic region was greater than that
  required for corrosion to proceed.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows a schematic
  representation of the results of the corrosion reactions, along the lines
  proposed by Schwenk [2].&nbsp; It can be seen that the cathodically produced
  hydroxyl is present at both the blistering and the delamination sites.&nbsp;
  The alkaline nature of this resultant solution at these sites is considered to
  be a major contributory factor in the failure of the coating.</p>

  <p>&sect;8 <b>Figure 1: An illustration of the blistering and delamination processes
  after [2]</b></p>
  <p>&sect;9 The reason this alkalinity causes such failure has been variously ascribed
  to saponification of the coating [3], dissolution of the oxide layer at the
  interface [4], alteration of the ionic resistance of the film [5, 6].</p>
  <p>&sect;10 One particular feature that has been identified by a number of workers, is
  a delay time or initiation period between a coated substrate first being
  exposed to a corrosive environment and the start of the blistering or
  delamination process taking place.&nbsp; Leidheiser [7] ascribes this delay as
  due to the time required to set up a steady state diffusion in the film;
  whether this diffusion was of water, oxygen or ions was unclear.&nbsp; Nguyen
  [8], on the other hand, suggests that the important route for diffusion is
  that of the cations along the paint/metal interface.&nbsp; Both
  interpretations provide explanations for the observed phenomena.</p>
  <p>&sect;11 The work described here is concerned with blistering and delamination of an
  alkyd coating. Part of the essential quality of this research is to use,
  wherever possible, non-destructive test methods.&nbsp; To this end, some work
  has been carried out to determine the feasibility of incorporating pH
  indicators into the organic coating under investigation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;12 The initial tests, described below, were carried out on an alkyd
  resin.&nbsp; The hypothesis of the tests was that cathodic areas under a clear
  resin coating may be identified by the high pH generated due to the presence
  of OH<sup>-</sup> produced by the oxygen reduction reaction; it should
  therefore be possible to track the delamination front as it proceeds along the
  interface.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  <h4>Specimen preparation</h4>
  <p>&sect;13 The substrates used for all the experiments were cold rolled, mild steel Q
  Panels.&nbsp; The panels were solvent de-greased and dried with paper towels
  before being coated in a dust free, ventilated, coating cabinet.&nbsp; The
  coatings were cured at room temperature for 48 hours and then stoved at 65-70<sup>o</sup>C
  for a further 48 hours. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;14 In order to provide an indication of the degree of protection offered by
  this coating, a control experiment was carried out to demonstrate the effect
  of immersing an unprotected substrate in the test solution of 0.5M NaCl.&nbsp;
  This was recorded with time lapse photography and the result is available as
  video1 in MPEG format in either <a href="v2p26vid1.mpg">medium</a> (2.6 Mb) or <a href="v2p26vid1_small.mpg">small</a>
  (0.9 Mb) size.&nbsp;<i>[Editor's note: there is always a compromise between
  file size and image quality for video clips - these are the
  best we can do at present - note that it will take about 1 hour to retrieve 10
  Mb using a V90 modem].</i></p>
  <p>&sect;15 In order to track the development of alkaline and therefore cathodic
  regions under the film, phenolphthalein pH indicator was incorporated into the
  wet coating, as detailed below.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;16 After testing various preparations of the indicator for incorporation into
  the coating, the optimum solution for the alkyd coating was determined to be
  1g phenolphthalein in 100ml EtOH + 100 ml water.&nbsp; Three panels were
  selected at random to test if the indicator would leach out of the
  coating.&nbsp; A drop of pH 13.5 buffer solution was placed on the surface of
  the coating.&nbsp; Within a minute, the droplet had turned pink as seen in
  figure 2.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><b>Figure 2 Effect of a phenolphthalein loaded coating upon a droplet of pH
  13.5 buffer solution</b></p>
  <p>&sect;18 The average DFT of the final coatings was 22mm.&nbsp; A 2mm hole was
  introduced into the cured coatings and the panels were fitted with a 30mm
  diameter perspex cylinder, 50mm high, which was filled with a 0.5M NaCl
  solution.&nbsp; The panels were left at ambient temperature for 10 days and
  were photographed at regular intervals.&nbsp; On the second run of the
  experiment, time-lapse photography was employed using a digital camera linked
  to a PC.&nbsp; Computerised videos were produced showing the progress of the
  breakdown of alkyd coatings, stills from these videos are included in the
  result section.</p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
  <p>&sect;19 Figure 3 shows the progression of the alkalinity of a typical panel.&nbsp;
  Note that after 10 days the alkaline front has progressed under the cylinder
  and along the panel for a short way.</p>

  <p>&sect;21 In all cases, the movement of the pink areas followed the lines of the
  rolling marks on the surface of the panel.&nbsp; Although this method provided
  a picture of the process as it occurred, it was felt that the use of
  time-lapse photography would produce data that would illustrate the picture
  more clearly, especially in terns of whether the blistering was in deed
  affected by the topography of the substrate.</p>
  <p>&sect;22 In the first experimental trial, the coating was applied across the
  striations of the panels and it was felt that this might have had an effect
  upon the ability of the coating to adequately wet the surface.&nbsp;
  Therefore, when the experiment was repeated, the coating was applied along the
  rolling marks with all other conditions remaining the same.</p>

  <p>This coating fared better, the period to breakdown was greater and the mode

  corrosion, the coating failed due to delamination and for the period of the

  <p>&sect;30 The progress of the breakdown of the coating is illustrated in figure 6 and
  as two sections of time-lapse video as video3a and 3b in MPEG format in medium
  (<a href="v2p26vid3a.mpg">3a</a>, 19 Mb and <a href="v2p26vid3b.mpg">3b</a>, 26 Mb) or small (<a href="v2p26vid3a_small.mpg">3a</a>,
  6.8 Mb and <a href="v2p26vid3b_small.mpg">3b</a>, 9.4 Mb) size.&nbsp;Note that there is&nbsp;
  magnification change on going from 3a to 3b. There is an initiation period where there is no sign of any
  activity under the coating, the progression as a function of time is as
  follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>81 hours: The first sign of alkalinity near the fault.</li>
    <li>50 hours: Alkaline regions are initiated some way from the fault.</li>
    <li>52 hours: Alkaline regions established and corrosion products are
      clearly visible at the fault.</li>
    <li>71 hours: Blisters coalesce and substrate at the fault is covered in
      corrosion products.</li>
    <li>81 hours: Delamination front begins to move away from the fault along
      the striations on the substrate.</li>
    <li>100 hours: Delamination front firmly established either side of the
      fault, still following the lines on the substrate.&nbsp; Initiation of new
      blisters at the periphery.</li>
    <li>125 hours: Original delamination zone lighter in colour.&nbsp;
      Peripheral blisters established.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&sect;31 At the end of the exposure period, the photographs were examined and a plot
  constructed of the percentage area of the exposed surface that was indicated
  as being alkaline.&nbsp; The results of this plot are given in figure 7,
  below.</p>

  <p align="left">&sect;32 <b>Figure 7: Percentage area of the exposed panel covered by
  blistering and delamination.</b></p>
  <h3 align="left">Discussion</h3>
  <p>&sect;33 The results presented here show quite clearly that, for the coating
  considered, not only do blistering and delamination processes share many
  common features but that they may be considered as constituent parts of one
  overall process.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;34 The process starts with the initiation of blisters around the region of the
  point of damage.&nbsp; These blisters become larger as time progresses until
  they eventually coalesce.&nbsp; Once this has occurred, the delamination
  process takes over and the front progresses rapidly.&nbsp; As the coating
  delaminates from the fault, the pH at the interface behind it falls as the
  process continues.</p>
  <p>&sect;35 Figure 7 indicates that the processes occurring under the film are cyclic
  in nature, starting with an initiation time where there is no apparent
  activity.&nbsp; Of course, the indicator used only functions at higher pHs so
  there would be a delay in its response.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the
  initial delay period coupled with the apparent inactivity indicated by the
  plateau at about 100 hours does provide evidence of a cyclic process in line
  with that proposed by Scantlebury [10].</p>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <p>&sect;36 Blistering and delamination act in conjunction with each other in the
  failure of organic coatings.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&sect;37 As blisters develop and grow, they coalesce to form a large disbonded
  region in the vicinity of a fault in the coating.&nbsp; This disbonded area
  provides the site for the delamination process to initiate and propagate.</p>
  <p>&sect;38 The initial delay time is repeated in a cyclic nature once the delamination
  reaches a critical point.&nbsp; At this point, the pH of the solution under
  the film at the disbonded area falls as the oxygen reduction reaction moves
  away from the fault.&nbsp; At this point, the delamination process gives way
  to further blistering under the intact coating.&nbsp; One could view the
  delamination front needing the blisters to act as stepping-stones in order to
  progress.</p>
