<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>&sect;1 The chemistry and structure at the scale/alloy interface are
important factors governing scale adhesion.  The chemical changes can occur
from segregation of impurities in the alloy, such as sulphur and carbon, or
alloying elements such as chromium, aluminium and reactive elements.  This
paper reviews studies of the changes of interfacial composition with oxidation
time for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> formed on several model alumina-forming
alloys, and tries to relate that to the interfacial strength.  Results show
that sulphur segregation to oxide/metal interfaces can indeed occur, but the
type and amount of segregants at the interface depend on the alloy composition
and the interface structure.  Co-segregation of impurities with alloying
elements can also occur, resulting in multi-layer segregants at the interface.
Sulphur-containing interfaces are indeed weaker, but the major role of sulphur
is to enhance interfacial void formation.  Reactive elements in the alloy not
only gather sulfur but also exert an additional positive effect on scale
adhesion.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>&sect;3 Many advances have been made in the past two decades on the
growth and development of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scales.  It is now known
that the first-formed Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are almost never the
thermodynamically most stable &alpha; form,
but are aluminas that have been identified as the &theta; and/or the &gamma; forms <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title="">[4]</a><a name="_Ref482086107">,</a><a name="_Ref42491401"></a><a href="#_edn5"
name="_ednref5" title="">[5].</a><a name="_Ref42491819"></a><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>.
These are often referred to as &quot;transition&quot; or &quot;metastable&quot;
aluminas.  The more stable &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
later nucleates at the transition alumina/alloy interface <a name="_Ref482086108"></a><a href="#_edn5">[5]</a>,<a href="#_edn6">[6]</a>,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>,
and the initially formed  alumina transforms to the &alpha; form with time.  Limited
high resolution
TEM studies <a name="_Ref42498530"></a><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"
title="">[8]</a> have shown that the interface between the transition alumina
and the alloy, in this case a single crystal NiAl, is coherent, but became incoherent
once &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nucleates.  The
development of &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
is faster at higher temperatures <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> and with the presence of chromium in the alloy <a href="#_edn10"
name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>,
but seems slower with higher concentrations of Al or the presence of a reactive
element (RE), such as Hf, Y or Zr, in the alloy <a href="#_edn11"
name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>.
The transition alumina grows predominantly by aluminium outward transport <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>,<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>,
but the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
by predominantly oxygen inward transport with a non-trivial amount of aluminium
outward diffusion <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> unless
a reactive element is present, then the Al outward transport is greatly
reduced <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>.
The growth rate of the transition alumina is about one order of magnitude
faster than that of the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
Extensive void formation at scale/alloy interfaces is observed without any
reactive element, particularly on Ni or Fe aluminides <a href="#_edn16"
name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a>,<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;4 The adherence of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scales on
alloys is an important issue for practical applications.  It has been known for
over 60 years <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>that the presence
of small amounts of RE in the alloy greatly improves Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
scale adhesion.  Many mechanisms have been proposed for this phenomenon <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>,
but in recent years, the most widely accepted one is what is known as the
&quot;sulphur effect&quot; <a name="_Ref471800009"></a><a href="#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a>,<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>.
The hypothesis is that the oxide/metal interface is intrinsically strong, but
indigenous sulphur that is present in the alloys, often around 10-30 ppm,
segregates to the interface during oxidation, thus weakens the bonding and
renders the scale nonadherent.  The role of the reactive element, as a result
of their strong sulphide forming ability, is to react and tie up the sulphur;
therefore, preventing it from segregating to the interface.  Evidence of the
detrimental effect of sulphur on scale adhesion has been provided by the
performance of many different desulphurized or low S alloys <a href="#_edn22"
name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>,<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a><a name="_Ref42652564">,</a><a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>.
When the sulphur content in the alloy is reduced to less than 3 ppm or so,
often by a high temperature H<sub>2</sub>-annealing process, scale spallation
under thermal cycling conditions becomes much less <a href="#_edn24">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;5 The proposed &quot;sulphur effect&quot; points to the importance
of how interface chemistry may affect scale adhesion.  Sulphur is well known
to
segregate to alloy grain boundaries and weakens them <a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>,
and theoretical studies have shown bond weakening effects of S on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/metal
interfaces <a name="_Ref42569963"></a><a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26"
title="">[26]</a>,<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a>.
Limited mechanical testing on the strength of diffusion bonded Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/metal
interfaces with the presence of a foreign element has also demonstrated strong
effects of interface chemistry <a name="_Ref42569965"></a><a href="#_edn28"
name="_ednref28" title="">[28],</a><a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a>,<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a>.
However, most of these studies did not characterize the effect these segregants
had on interface microstructure, particularly on defect type, size and distribution.
This is especially important, since more debonded areas seem to exist when
impurities are present at these interfaces <a href="#_edn26">[26]</a>,<a href="#_edn28">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;6 Since all commercial metals and alloys contain ppm levels of
non-metallic impurities that readily segregate to surfaces when the alloy is
heated, it is often assumed that the same kind of segregation takes place at
oxide/metal interfaces.  Whether this is always the case is not known.  The
purpose of this paper is to summarize work done in recent years in our
laboratory on the chemical changes at several Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/alloy
interfaces in order to provide a better understanding of the segregation
phenomena that occur during scale growth.</p>

<p>&sect;7 Results and discussions are presented separately for three
groups of alloys: iron aluminides, nickel aluminides and MCrAl, where M is Fe
or Ni.  In each section, the segregation behaviour is first discussed and
related to surface segregation, alloy composition and the oxide growth process.
Subsequently, the relationship between segregation, interface morphology and any
existing data on interfacial strengths is addressed.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>&sect;8 Several different types of model alloys were studied; these
include nickel and iron aluminides, Zr-doped iron aluminide and MCrAl type
alloy with M being Fe or Ni.  The stoichiometric NiAl and the iron aluminides
were made at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  The NiCrAl was supplied by
NASA; other alloys were made at LBNL.  All the alloys were induction or arc
melted, followed by a high temperature anneal in inert atmospheres.  15mm x 10
mm x 1mm sized specimens were either cut from the ingot or from a hot rolled
sheet.  Hydrogen-annealing of a few alloy specimens was performed in
Zr-gettered hydrogen at 1200&deg;C for 100
hours.  The alloy identifications, compositions and sulphur and carbon impurity
levels are given in Table 1.  It is seen that the nickel alumnides have much
lower sulphur contents than the other alloys, indicating that the starting powders
of Fe and Cr must contain more S impurity than Ni.  Other than C and S
impurities, the NiAl and FeAl alloys also contain tens of ppm of B and P
respectively.<i>  </i>In order to increase the S content of the NiAl, a batch
of Ni-40at%Al was made with small amounts of NiS, and it is identified as the S-doped
alloy, i.e., Ni40Al(S).</p>

<p>&sect;10 One face of the specimen was polished to a 1 &micro;m finish with diamond paste prior to
oxidation in 1 atmosphere flowing dry oxygen.  Most tests were conducted at
1000<sup>o</sup>C, with some at 900&deg;C
or 1100<sup>o</sup>C.  The specimen was placed in an alumina boat with a
thermocouple at its back to monitor its surface temperature, and then pushed
into the hot zone of a horizontal furnace to start the oxidation.  At the end
of the desired oxidation time the boat and specimen were quickly pulled out of
the furnace and cooled in ambient air.  A few specimens were also
water-quenched or furnace-cooled in order to establish different cooling rates.</p>

<p>&sect;11 The chemistry of the scale/alloy interface after oxidation
was examined using a PHI 660 Scanning Auger Electron Microscope (AES), where
  a specially designed linear translator mounted with a Vickers micro-indenter
  had
been placed in its ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber.  To make a scratch, the
oxidized specimen was first pushed into the indenter using the Z-control of the
specimen stage, followed by a drag along the X or the Y direction for several
millimetres <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a>.
This motion often produced numerous fractures adjacent to the scratch mark and
induced spallation of the oxide scale, which exposed the scale/alloy
interface.  The vacuum condition during and after the scratch was usually
better than 2&times;10<sup>-10</sup> torr.  A 0.5-1 &micro;m
diameter electron beam was placed on the exposed alloy surface to study its
composition.  Usually 10-15 areas on each specimen were surveyed at 10 kV and
90&deg; incident angle.  With the attached
scanning electron microscope (SEM), the morphology of the surveyed area, such
as interfacial pores, alloy grains and convoluted ridges or valleys of the
interface could be distinguished.  The scratch motion also caused pieces of
oxide scales to flip over such that the underside of the spalled oxide could
be
analyzed as well.  The composition at the scale underside was always only O and
Al.  All segregants remained on the alloy side after scale spallation.</p>

<p>&sect;12 One specimen was examined using a PHI model 670 field
emission AES (FEAES), which has a typical probe size of 30 nm <a name="_Ref41372417"></a><a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a>.
This small probe provided the chemical analysis of individual facets on the
alloy surface without any possible inclusion of nearby interfacial pores.  A
few alloys were also studied using a micro X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (&micro;XPS)
to distinguish the chemical states of
the segregants <a name="_Ref42580363"></a><a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33"
title="">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;13 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the scale and
alloy phases, and more detailed examination of the scale and interface
morphology was performed using field emission SEM after the Auger analysis.</p>

<h3>Results and Discussions</h3>

<h4>Iron Aluminides</h4>

<p>&sect;14 The only segregant found at the
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/FeAl interfaces was sulphur.  The amount of S as
a
function of oxidation time for the Fe40Al and the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al are
presented in Figure 1(a) and (b) respectively.  The surface atomic percent was
calculated using peak heights and tabulated Auger sensitivity factors <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>.
The coverage in monolayer was determined from the attenuation of the Fe signal
compared to that of the starting alloy.  On Fig. 1(a), results from FEAES are
also included along with a calculated S content (interface sweeping) assuming
the interface grows entirely inward with time and all the S impurity in the
alloy accumulates at the interface.</p>

<p>Representative microstructures indicated
in Fig. 1 are given in Figure 2.  The initially formed scale, Fig. 2(a),
consisted of fine-grained &theta; and &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, leaving a
rather smooth and featureless interface.  Isolated &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> grains formed randomly at the
interface and made a few facetted imprints on the alloy surface.  After the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> developed into
a complete layer, the alloy surface was covered with facets where the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> grains had been
in contact with the alloy before scale spallation, Fig. 2(b).  Occasionally,
interfacial voids that developed very early on and were several times larger
than the oxide grains could be found.  There were also smaller voids existing
mainly at &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
grain junctions.  These voids provide information on the segregation behaviour
on free surfaces under the oxidation condition; hence can be used as a direct
comparison between what was detected at the interface.</p>

<p>&sect;18 At the free surfaces, or void faces, saturation was reached
early.  Using the model of Lea and Seah <a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35"
title="">[35]</a>and the bulk S content reported in Table 1, the rate to reach
saturation gave
an approximate S diffusivity of 3 x 10<sup>-8 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/s at 1000&deg;C,
which falls within the range reported for S diffusion in Fe and Ni-based alloys
<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36"
title="">[36]</a>,<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a>,<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a><i>.</i>
Although S usually segregates on metals at a saturation level of 0.5 monolyer
<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a>,
the amount found here on void faces is higher, especially on the large voids.
Although the data points have been grouped together here with error bars, it
has been shown in an earlier publication <a href="#_edn32">[32]</a> that the
amount of S increased with void growth and that S co-segregated with Al to the
void
surfaces, but similar co-segregation was not found at the interface.</p>

<p>&sect;19 The small probe of FEAES placed on individual imprinted
grain facets on Fe40Al detected lower S content than that obtained from the
conventional AES with a 0.5-1 &micro;m probe,
indicating that the larger probe included sub-micron voids that had higher S
contents (Fig. 1a).  Nevertheless, the trend of S built up with oxidation time
was not affected by the probe size.  For the Fe40Al, no S was detected at the
interface between the first formed &gamma; and/or &theta;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, nor was it
found at the base of the first nucleated, isolated &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> grain imprints.  S started to
appear at the interface only after a complete &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
layer developed at the interface at about 1hr at 1000<sup>o</sup>C.  As the
scale grew, the interfacial S content increased slowly until a saturation level
of about half a monolayer was reached.  The amount of S detected at the
interface was significantly higher than that calculated from interface
sweeping.  This indicates that sulphur indeed segregated to the interface
during scale growth.</p>

<p>&sect;20 The observed slow sulphur built up at Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe40Al
interfaces is rather surprising.  The rate is definitely not limited by S
diffusion in the alloy, in light of what was observed on the void surfaces.
Since the transition from the absence of S at the interface to its first
appearance is related to the transformation of the metastable transition Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
to &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, it is
possible that the interfacial segregation behaviour is related to the type of
interface formed between the alloy and the different aluminas.  This is
especially plausible because past results have indicated that the interface
between &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and a single crystal NiAl is coherent, but becomes incoherent once &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> forms <a href="#_edn8">[8]</a>.
However, whether the same is true for Fe40Al is unknown.</p>

<p>&sect;21 The fact that S was not detected beneath isolated, first
nucleated &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
grains, but only appeared after the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
had impinged onto one another to form a complete layer at the interface
suggests that segregation is not related to the phase of the alumina per se,
but to the interface structure that must be changing continuously in response
to the growth process, and in this case, probably the growth stress that arose
from the impingement of &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
into a complete layer.  To relax this stress, grains at the interface may
undergo reorientation or rearrangements.  These processes should alter the
interface microstructure.  As the microstructure changes, segregation energy
will also change.  The less coherent the interface, the more favourable it is
for S to segregate.  The process would be similar to that observed at alloy
grain boundaries, where the extent of solute segregation often depends on the
boundary structure <a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a>,<a name="_Ref482083922"></a><a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a>,
with the tilt angle probably being the most significant factor <a name="_Ref482083924"></a><a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;22 For the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al, the segregation behaviour at the
interface was even more surprising (Fig. 1b).  At both 1000 and 900&deg;C, the S content was initially high, went
through a minimum of almost zero, then increased slowly to a steady state level
similar to that found on the Fe40Al alloy.  Greater spatial variations, not
related to alloy grains, exist at shorter oxidation times, as indicated by the
larger error bars.  This means that the sulphur content at the alloy surface
under these initial scales varied locally within the probe size of a 0.5-1 &micro;m diameter area.  After the minimum point,
the amount of S at different locations of the interface became much more
uniform.  The minimum for both temperatures corresponded again to the
development of a complete layer of &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
at the interface.</p>

<p>&sect;25 Judging from how fast void surfaces were covered with S, the
  initial high sulphur content at the interface must be a result of segregation
  upon heating of the sample.  Unlike Fe40Al, where the initially formed
  transition alumina/alloy interface was inaccessible to S, the interface here,
  or at least portions of it with sub-micro dimensions, somehow allowed this S
  segregation.  As oxidation continues, the initially segregated S began to
  desegregate from the interface.  Plane-view TEM examinations of the early stage
  scales revealed many randomly distributed &quot;star-shaped&quot; features, as
  illustrated in Fig. 3(a).  The bands consisted of mainly &theta;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and some &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> grains that
  were significantly larger than those in the surrounding area, which seemed to
  be a mixture of very fine-grained &theta;, &gamma; and
  &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.  The
  presence of &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
  at this early stage on Fe<sub>3</sub>Al is surprising.  The 5%Cr in this particular alloy may have assisted the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> formation.  The
grains in the bands were preferentially oriented with the substrate, as seen
from the higher intensity loci on the diffraction rings and the dark field
image (Fig. 3b).  The loci are arranged with a 6-fold symmetry about the direct
beam.  The arced loci indicate that not all grains in the bands have the exact
epitaxial relationship with the alloy, but that they were constrained with a
~20<sup>o</sup> in-plane rotation from that relationship.  With longer
oxidation time, the amount of &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
increased, and the volume fraction of these bands decreased from 22.6 to 13.9
to 0% when the oxidation time at 900<sup>o</sup>C increased from 4.5 to 30 to
190 min.  This decreasing trend happened to match the initial decrease of the
sulphur level at the interface.  Is it possible that more S was present at the
band/alloy interface, or is this relationship purely coincidental?  It is
difficult to imaging why a nearly epitaxial oxide/alloy interface should
accommodate S more favourably.  Instead, maybe the change in S content was
related to the change of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase in the scale
from predominantly &theta; to &gamma;.  However, due to their small sizes and the
overlapping diffraction rings of the three aluminas, phase identification has
been difficult.  Work is currently under way to better study the phases in
different regions and to examine the interface with TEM on cross-sections of
these scales.</p>

<p>&sect;26 Fig. 1(b) also shows the absence of any detectable S on the
Zr-doped or the H<sub>2</sub>-annealed Fe<sub>3</sub>Al.  Interface area on the
Zr-containing alloy was very difficult to find, since cohesive failure seldom
occur at the scale/alloy interface due to its high strength.  Analyses of the
interface could only be performed from limited small areas.  Zr was not
detected, probably due to its low Auger sensitivity.  A previous study on this
particular alloy has detected Zr segregation at the interface using analytical
TEM <a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a>;
many other studies have also shown that RE segregates at scale/alloy interfaces
<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a>.
The amount was quantified by one study to be 0.2-0.3 monolayer <a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a>.
The &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scale
on the H<sub>2</sub>-annealed specimens spalled easily from the scratching
force.  Failure always occurred at the scale/alloy interface, although no S was
ever detected <a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a>,<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47]</a>.
Experimentally determined detection limit for S is better than 0.04 monolayer,
so these apparently clean interfaces still failed cohesively.</p>

<p>Adhesion wise, scales formed on the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al
specimen started to spall during cooling after their thickness reached ~0.3 &micro;m.  Shortly
above this thickness, the
interface also started convoluting <a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48]</a>.
An example of this morphology is given in Fig. 4(a) showing convoluted, or
wrinkled, scale and interface, and areas where the scale spalled during
cooling.  Voids could also be found at these interfaces at the very early stage
of oxidation; approximate void density corresponding to the scale thickness
when spontaneous spallation began is given in Table 2.  </p>

<p>&sect;29 The H<sub>2</sub>-annealing not only prevented interfacial
void formation, but also interface wrinkling such that it stayed fairly flat.
Nevertheless, spallation in circular shapes still occurred after the scale
reached about 3 &micro;m, as seen in Fig.
4(b).  The alloy with Zr addition also did not show any interface or scale
convolution, but the interface appeared much stronger.  Spallation during
cooling was not observed.  Scratching could hardly induce cohesive failure, as
discussed earlier.  A four-point-bend test was performed on this alloy with a
scale formed at 1000<sup>o</sup>C for 120 hr.  Even then, spallation did not
occur at a maximum load of 650 N; only tensile cracking in the scale was
observed (Fig. 4c).  </p>

<p>&sect;31 Approximate interfacial energy (G<sub>c</sub>) was
determined using <i>G<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;&#8776;&nbsp;&sigma;<sup>2</sup>t/E</i>, and
presented in Table 2;  <i>t </i> and E are, respectively, the thickness and the
Young's modulus of the scale, and &sigma; is
the residual stress in the scale.  For the Zr-containing alloy, &sigma; was taken as
the maximum 4-pt bend load; for the other two, the thermal mismatch stress between
the alloy and the oxide
was used.  Plastic deformation of the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al-Zr alloy during the bend
test contributed to its high G<sub>c</sub> value.  Although these values may
be
off by a factor of 4 <a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49]</a>,
they still provide a good indication of the relative effect of S and Zr on
scale adhesion.  According to the data summarized in Table 2, it can been seen
that i) S in the alloy enhances void formation, ii) Zr prevents S segregation
to the interface and iii) the S-free interface of the Zr-containing alloy is
significantly stronger than the one without Zr, probably due to a bond
strengthening effect of Zr segregation to the interface.</p>

<p>&sect;32 One last point that is worth discussing is the flatness of
the scale on the H<sub>2</sub>-annealed and the Zr-doped alloy compared to that
of the undoped starting alloy (Fig. 4).  Similar results have also been
reported for FeCrAl, where the scale/alloy interface on the normal purity alloy
wrinkled extensively, but the interface remained flat when the alloy had been
H<sub>2</sub>-annealed
or contained a reactive element <a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50]</a>.
These results seem to indicate that the presence of S at the interface
facilitates interface convolution.  One possibility is that S enhances
interface diffusion, as it does surface diffusion <a href="#_edn51"
name="_ednref51" title="">[51]</a>;
therefore enhancing material transport along the interface to assist
kinetically this interface instability process.</p>

<h4>Nickel Aluminides</h4>

<p>&sect;33 The time dependence of interfacial segregation has not been
studied as extensively on these alloys as on the other two types.  Limited data
on how the interface chemistry changes with oxidation time can be found in a
recent publication <a name="_Ref42584749"></a><a href="#_edn52"
name="_ednref52" title="">[52]</a>.
The results reported here concentrate on comparing the behaviour of
stoichiometric NiAl, Ni-rich Ni-40Al and a S-doped Ni-40Al.</p>

<p>&sect;34 The interface microstructures on
NiAl and Ni40Al after scale removal were similar to those shown for the iron aluminides, consisting of &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
grain imprinted areas (identified as 'interface') and interfacial voids that
deepened into the alloy, an example can be seen in Fig. 5a.  The only
difference is that there were fewer small voids between the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> grains.</p>

<p>&sect;35 Segregation to the surface of NiAl
was very dependent on its crystallographic orientation.  This is indicated by
more than one group of data given for each segregant in Table 3.  Since carbon
adsorption onto clean alloy surfaces often took place under the electron beam,
especially if the sample surface was not very clean, the background C level
could sometimes be rather high, giving rise to large standard deviations.
After 26 hrs at 1000&deg;C, C was the major
impurity on void faces.  There was no S; B and P tended to segregate on different
orientations.  After 100 hrs, S began to segregate to the voids; consequently,
the amount of C decreased.  The presence of S also reduced B segregation, but
did not affect that of P.</p>

<p>The void faces of Ni40Al, on the other hand, were covered
with a high concentration of S much earlier than NiAl.  Since both the normal
purity NiAl and Ni40Al have similar bulk sulphur contents (2-4 ppm), the
difference in saturation rate must be the result of faster S diffusion in
Ni40Al than in NiAl.  From these segregation results, approximate S diffusion
coefficients in the two alloys were calculated to be 6&times;10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s
for Ni40Al and 1&times;10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for NiAl.  The much slower
rate in stoichiometric NiAl is consistent with the fact that Ni diffusion in
NiAl is almost 10 times slower than that in Ni40Al <a href="#_edn53"
name="_ednref53" title="">[53]</a>.
The magnitude of S diffusion calculated here is also in agreement with recent
data from S segregation studies on NiAl surfaces <a href="#_edn54"
name="_ednref54" title="">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;38 The interface areas on the NiAl were mostly free from any
sulphur or carbon.  Some areas contained boron, or phosphorus and boron, but
SEM observations were not able to associate any interface features with their
presence.  The occurrence of P and B decreased with longer oxidation time, up
to 100 hours, and higher temperatures, up to 1150<sup>o</sup>C, yet the
interface continued to be free from carbon or sulphur, even when S already
segregated to the void surfaces.</p>

  scale spallation.  (a) Ni40Al, 1000<sup>o</sup>C, 26h and (b) Ni-40Al(S), 1000<sup>o</sup>C,
  10min.</p>
<p>&sect;40 At the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ni40Al
interface, a small amount of sulphur was always detected with no other
impurities.  The amount of S at these interfaces is less than 2at% (about 0.2
monolayer), which is less than that observed on Fe40Al.  The S-doped Ni-40Al,
containing &gt;30 ppm S, had similar interface chemistry as the normal purity
Ni-40Al that contains only a few ppm of S.  However, scale adhesion on the
S-doped specimens was extremely poor.  After 26 hr oxidation, almost the entire
scale spalled upon cooling, so only specimens with thin scales that formed for
short times can be analyzed.  The most pronounced effect of the S-doping was to
increase the number of pores at the scale/alloy interface, as seen in Fig. 5.
While the average void density for the normal purity NiAl after 26 hr
oxidation was (0.7&plusmn;0.5)/100 &micro;m<sup>2</sup>,
it was more than 10 times higher, at (11.0&plusmn;2.7)/100 &micro;m<sup>2</sup>, for the S-doped after only 10min oxidation.
Further oxidation resulted in coalescence and growth of these pores, causing
extensive scale spallation during cooling.</p>

<p>&sect;41 The segregation behaviour at &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiAl
and Ni40Al interfaces again showed some interesting phenomena.  First of all,
here is an interface, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiAl, which did not show any
S segregation, even when S already covered most of its void faces.  Instead,
some locations of this interface were found with small amounts of B or B and
P.  Secondly, an alloy with less Al, Ni40Al, but with the same phase and
similar bulk impurity contents, forming an interface with the same type of
oxide under the same oxidation conditions, consistently showed sulphur at its
interface.  Why should sulphur prefer one but not the other?  Wetting studies
of NiAl on sapphire <a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55]</a>,
and theoretical analysis on metal/ceramic bonding <a href="#_edn56"
name="_ednref56" title="">[56]</a>have shown that the interface energy between Ni(Al)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
decreases with increasing Al activity near the alumina dissociation pO<sub>2</sub>.
This would imply that the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ni40Al interface formed
during oxidation has a higher energy than the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiAl
interface, such that sulphur segregation may be more favoured on the Ni40Al to
lower its energy.  Whether the same difference will be observed between Fe40Al
and FeAl would be worth investigating, especially since S has already been shown
to segregate to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe40Al interfaces (Fig. 1a).
Another difference that might exist between the Fe and the Ni aluminides, which
is currently being evaluated, is the build up of S with oxidation time,
especially at the initial stage while the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at the
interface has not yet transformed to the &alpha;-form.</p>

<p>&sect;42 Using a simple tensile pull-test <a href="#_edn52">[52]</a>, the adherence of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
scales formed on these nickel aluminide alloys was found to be dictated by the
number of interfacial pores, as seen in Fig. 6.   The test was done by pulling
a 3mm diameter stub under continually increasing loads until failure occurred,
which often took place at the scale/alloy interface.  The stub was bonded to
the oxide surface via an epoxy that has a maximum failure stress of 103 MPa.
Analysis of interfacial pore density was conducted on each failed area from SEM
micrographs.  The data points in Fig. 6 were obtained from several NiAl and
Ni40Al alloys.  Although S was present at the Ni40Al but not at the NiAl
interfaces, its presence did not make a difference within the scatter of the data.
The S-doped NiAl with a high pore density of 11/&micro;m<sup>2</sup>
after only 10 min oxidation failed at 4.9 MPa, had the lowest interface
strength tested so far.  These results show very clearly that the dominating
effect of S is to enhance interfacial pore formation.  These defects
deteriorate the interface strength more dramatically than any bond weakening
effect caused by the presence of S at the interface.  There seems to be some
indications that for the same pore density, the interfaces under thicker scales
are weaker.  This may be a pore size effect, which was not taken into account.
More work is being conducted on the effect of oxidation time, and to relate
that to the interface microstructure and chemistry.</p>

  interface. (b) Typical AES spectrum of the saturation level on most FeCrAl
  interfaces (shaded area) and (c), spectrum of the NiCrAl interface.</p>
<p>&sect;45 Unlike the aluminides, these interfaces had a much higher
sulphur concentration.  On most of the interface areas, S built up as quickly
as it would segregate to the free surface, reaching a high saturation level.  Within
the shaded band in Fig. 7(a), this saturation level is seen to be rather insensitive to the oxidation temperature, the cooling
rate, or any interface features, such as voids or the valleys and ridges that
formed under the convoluted scale of FeCrAl, and the amount has been determined
to be more than two monolayers <a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57]</a>.
Apart from S, the interfaces were also enriched with Cr (Table 4), where the
average Cr content in the alloy was only 16.1at%.  On the FeCrAl, there was in
addition segregated carbon, but C was not found on the NiCrAl  (Fig. 7b, c).  The
dependence of segregants on cooling rates, seen in Table 4, clearly indicated
that sulphur was present during oxidation; Cr was slightly enriched at the
oxidation temperature, and quickly diffused to the interface during cooling due
to the short diffusion distance and the abundance of Cr in the alloy.  All the
carbon diffused to the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/FeCrAl interface during
cooling, which is consistent with its high diffusivity in bcc iron <a name="_Ref42586877"></a><a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58]</a>.
The driving force is the presence of excess Cr at the interface due to the
tendency for chromium carbide formation.  Since carbon diffusion in the fcc Ni
is much slower <a href="#_edn58">[58]</a>, it was absent on the NiCrAl interface.  Direct
relationships exist between interfacial concentrations of C and Cr, as well as
S and Cr, and these have been shown elsewhere <a href="#_edn59"
name="_ednref59" title="">[59]</a>.
The concomitant increase of S and Cr suggests their co-segregation to the
interface during oxidation.</p>

<p>&sect;47 Occasionally, areas with lower sulphur contents were found on
the FeCrAl, as seen from a group of data points below the shaded band on Fig.
7(a).  Their average concentration, given in Table 4, showed much less Cr
enrichment.  The Cr content was close to that of the substrate (16.1%), and the
S was about 50% lower than the most common levels found in the shaded band in
Fig.
7.  This lower concentration of interfacial sulphur compares well with the
level found on the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe40Al
interfaces (Fig. 1a) where there was no Cr segregation.  It is quite
significant that much lower interfacial S was found when the surface was not
enriched with Cr.  The behaviour again points to co-segregation effects of Cr
and S.  The positive interaction of the two can change the segregation coverage
in a way that saturation is more easily achieved and becomes much less
sensitive to temperature changes <a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title="">[60]</a>.
Similar occurrences have been reported on free surfaces for Fe-Cr alloys <a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title="">[61]</a>and there are also qualitative
indications of S and Cr co-segregation onto a
FeCrAl alloy surface upon heating <a href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title="">[62]</a>.</p>

    <p>&sect;48 Figure 8: XPS depth profile of FeCrAl surface after scale removal, and a proposed
  schematic of the segregatn structure on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/FeCrAl
  interface.</p>
<p>&sect;49 Examination of the exposed FeCrAl surface after Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
scale removal was also done using &micro;XPS
with a beam size of ~2 &micro;m <a href="#_edn33">[33]</a>.
Fig. 8(a) shows the result of a slow depth profiling from the alloy side of the
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/FeCrAl interface.  Graphite and oxygen were surface contaminants.  The segregated elements, i.e. S, Cr and C,
were present on the surface, where two regimes can be distinguished.  The outer
one was enriched with S and Cr and the inner one with Cr and carbide.  Depth
wise, the outer part was thinner and sharper, as seen from the sulphur
profile.  The inner part, on the other hand, had longer tails of decreasing Cr
and C concentrations extending into the alloy, suggesting sluggish diffusion,
which is consistent with the conclusion made earlier about Cr and C diffusing
to the interface during cooling.  All of the detected sulphur was present as
sulphide that peaked at energies between 161-161.6 eV.  For Cr, its metal,
carbide and sulphide all have binding energies close to 574.5 eV <a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title="">[63]</a>,<a href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title="">[64]</a>,<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title="">[65]</a>.
However, the concomitant enrichments of S and C with Cr suggest that the
chromium was present as a combination of Cr sulphide and carbide.  Based on
this depth profile and the quantitative analysis of the AES results, the
structure of segregants at Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/FeCrAl interfaces can
be
understood by the schematics shown in Fig. 8b.  Although most of the C and Cr
segregated during cooling, they should be present at a temperature before
spallation took place, which was usually several hundred degrees lower than the
oxidation temperature.  Therefore, when the scale fails, the interface
chemistry is that of multi-layer segregants.  This structure is very different
from a simple sub-monolayer inclusion of S at the interface.  To date, there
is
no theoretical calculation that predicts how such multi-layered sulphur,
co-segregated with Cr and C, would affect adhesion.</p>

<p>Figure 9: H<sub>2</sub>-annealed NiCrAl after 120h at 1000<sup>o</sup>C showing
  scratch induced spallation that took place at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/alloy
  interface and a typical interface AES spectrum.</p>
<p>The H<sub>2</sub>-annealed NiCrAl behaved similarly to that
  of the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al, whereby spallation during cooling was significantly
  extended to thicker oxides, i.e., longer oxidation times, indicating improved
  scale adhesion.  However, scratching under load, normally 500-1000g, could
  still cause scale fracture and fairly large areas of spallation that occurred
  at the scale/alloy interface (Fig. 9).  AES analysis of these exposed interface
  areas did not detect any segregants, not S
or C.  This is true on the underside of the scale as well.  So again,
apparently clean interfaces failed adhesively.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>&sect;51 Studies of impurity segregation to growing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/alloy
interfaces have shown the following:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li>Sulphur can surely segregate to intact Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/alloy
     interfaces during scale growth.</li>
 <li>While NiAl and Ni40Al contain similar levels of indigenous
     sulphur impurity, S segregated to the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ni40Al
     interface but was never detected at the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiAl
     interface.  The difference is probably related to a higher interface
     energy of the former.</li>
 <li>Sulphur was the only segregant found on the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>Al,
     Fe-40Al interfaces.  It appeared after the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
     formed a complete layer at the interface.  Prior to that, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe40Al
     interface was free from segregants, but S segregated to the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>Al
     interface upon oxidation but later desegregated.  This dependence of
     interface S content on scale growth may be related to the continually
     changing interface microstructure between the first-formed alumina and
     those that developed at later stages.</li>
 <li>On FeCrAl and NiCrAl alloys, Cr co-segregated with sulphur
     causing a higher than 1 monolayer S coverage at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/alloy
     interface at all times.  Carbon also segregated to the alumina-FeCrAl, but
     not NiCrAl, interface during cooling.</li>
</ol>

<p>&sect;52 These results clearly demonstrate that impurity segregation
to growing oxide/alloy interfaces can vary significantly on alloy compositions
and on interface structures that result from the oxidation process.</p>

<p>&sect;53 Relating segregation to limited interface fracture studies
show that</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>The major effect of sulphur, as least in NiAl alloys, was
     to enhance interfacial void formation.  This essentially created a weaker
     interface by increasing its defect concentration.</li>
 <li>Sulphur-containing interfaces were weaker than S-free
     interfaces (&lt;0.04 monolyer), although the latter can still fail
     adhesively.  The interface formed on reactive element containing alloys
     was also S-free but much stronger, suggesting a positive effect of RE on
     scale adhesion, rather than just preventing S from segregating to the
     interface.</li>
</ul>
