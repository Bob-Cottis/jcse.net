<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>

<p>This work describes a theoretical model for the mechanism
involved in a triode glow discharge employed to grow aluminium nitride films. A
series of systematic studies were carried out at varying degrees of cathode
voltage, cathode current density, pressure range and ion collector voltage
values over a fixed period of time. All films developed were characterised
using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Electron Dispersion X- ray Analysis, X- ray
Diffraction and micro hardness tests. This project has collated a basic
theoretical model that can be applied to produce films of different materials.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>&sect;2 Aluminium nitride (AlN) is a
binary III-V compounds with a wurtzite-type structure. The electron to atom
ratio is 4:1. The structure shows an irregular distribution of tetrahedral
bonds with a c/a axis ratio of AlN being 1.6. [<script>crossref(1)</script>] It has an outstanding
combination of properties. They are high thermal conductivity (320 W/mK),
excellent physical and chemical stability at high temperatures (melting point
is about 2400 &deg;C), optical transparency in the visible and near
infrared (IR), piezoelectric and good insulating properties (the band gap is
approximately 6.3eV ) and high hardness (HV 1400). Aluminium nitride is mainly
used as a high strength special material to harden the surface and in the
microelectronics industry as a basic material acting for passivation of
semiconductor surface, transmission of surface acoustic waves etc. [<script>crossref(2)</script>]</p>

<p>&sect;3 The use of an intensified glow
discharge in a triode system to enhance the plasma to deposit aluminium nitride
was initiated in 1991. [<script>crossref(3)</script>] This technique known as Intensified Plasma
Assisted Processing (IPAP), is an improvement from traditional glow discharge
techniques. Plasma intensification is produced by thermionic emission. Meletis  [<script>crossref(3)</script>]
carried out the first High Intensified Plasma Assisted Processing (IPAP) work
to develop coatings on aluminium. Their initial work proved the system to be
advantageous over conventional nitriding using a diode. They carried out the
work in two ranges of the plasma energy spectrum. The first HEPAP work at
Manchester Metropolitan University was started in 1996  [<script>crossref(4)</script>] to extend
the operating parameters using a balanced RF system to the substrate for the
deposition of AlN. This paper describes the details of the optimum conditions
achieved and the quantitative/qualitative model used in IPAP.</p>

<h3>Experimental</h3>

<p>&sect;4 The IPAP system was built
around a water cooled non-magnetic stainless steel vessel ( Figure 1). The
negative emission source with filament and a DC powered positive plate were
positioned facing one another across the inside of the vessel and were
controlled separately. The RF powered substrate holder was connected to a matching
network that enabled the process operation in the automatic mode. The system
was continually pumped and included a heating and pre-mixing nitrogen-argon
container. A plasma was sustained in the system across the pressure range 1.33
x 10<sup>3</sup> Pa to 1.33 x 10 <sup>-1</sup> Pa. The substrate used was 1.5
cm thick and had a diameter of 5 cm. It was air craft quality HE30 grade
aluminium (Al 98% by wt.)</p>

<p>&sect;5 Initially the system was
evacuated to 1.33 x 10 <sup>-4</sup> Pa and flushed several times with argon.
In order to remove the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer formed on the surface
due to oxidation the samples were sputter cleaned with the substrate voltage at
2000V with argon for 10 minutes. The argon gas was phased out gradually whilst
simultaneously introducing nitrogen. All samples after each experiment were
removed from the chamber and characterised. Several sets of experiments were
done using unpolished and polished aluminium grade HE30. In all cases the
experiments were carried out by varying each parameter over 7 stages. There
were four variable parameters (viz: cathode voltage, nitrogen gas pressure,
cathode current density and ion collector voltage) and initially one parameter
was changed whilst the other three parameters were kept constant. Next, two
parameters were changed while the other two were kept constant. Then three
parameters were changed whilst one parameter was kept constant and finally all
parameters were changed to obtain the optimum working range which gave a
thicker deposition. These values were compared with predicted optimum parameters
to establish a possible correlation for the future. </p>

<p>&sect;7 Scanning Electon Microscopy (SEM)
and Electron Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Auger
Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and surface hardness were performed on the coatings
deposited. The quality of the layer produced was affected by the cleanliness of
the surface to be coated . The physical nature of the surface to be treated
determined the pre-treatments required to get the thicker deposition. At this
stage the surface was carefully inspected for signs of contamination or damage.
Any undesirable matter was removed from the surface prior to treatment. This
involved breaking of the bonds between the contaminants and the substrate
surface either by physical or chemical methods. The polishing therefore was
done until a fine mirror-like surface was obtained. After the polishing stage,
the sample was washed with acetone to obtain a clean surface. </p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>&sect;8 The layers deposited were
characterised for hardness, structure and composition. The appearances of these
samples were light black due to compositional difference and the surface layers
were highly adherent and dense. In conventional nitriding at temperatures lower
than 400 &deg;C the adhesion is very poor and improves with increasing
temperature. During HEPAP a meta -stable Al<sub>3</sub>N is thought to form due
to the energetic ion bombardment. It is believed that this aspect plays an
important role in promoting adhesion by reducing compressive thermal stress
arising due to differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the Al<sub>3</sub>N
coating and the Al substrate.</p>

<p>&sect;9 The microstructure of the IPAP
films grown on to Al substrates revealed interesting features. The films
appeared to be growing in a vertical direction as is evident by the columnar
structure shown in figure 2. Following initial deposition, the rate of growth
in the vertical direction appeared to be much greater than the growth rate in
the horizontal direction. It is also evident that outgrowth occurs from the
substrate surface as aluminium atoms are removed due to sputtering caused by
high energy bombardment of the surface. The Al<sub>3</sub>N phase seemed to be
an important feature in this columnar mode of growth in this deposition method.</p>

<p>&sect;10 For engineering applications the
micro-hardness is an important property that determine the in-service
performance. Figure 3 shows the surface micro-hardness of IPAP coatings
compared to conventional plasma coatings. It is clearly evident that the IPAP
process produces coatings which are three times harder than plasma nitride
coating. In general, a greater resistance to wear can be expected with an increase
in micro-hardness which ultimately means longer in-service of the component.</p>

<p>&sect;11 The composition of the AlN
coatings was analysed using a SEM and EDS. Peaks showing the presence of Al ,N,
Si/W, Ti, Fe and Ar were evident. Signals from the base material and the
filament also showed up in the spectrum. Initial examination of the texture
revealed the presence of cubic Al<sub>3</sub>N phases at orientations of
(200),(311),(400) (see figure 5). </p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>&sect;12 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
order to explain the mechanism of HEPAP we attempted to develop an acceptable
theoretical model. In this the major issue was the energy distribution of ions
and neutrals in the dark space. Davis and Vanderslice  [<script>crossref(5)</script>] and Rickards
 [<script>crossref(6)</script>] have done several studies on the distribution and their effect</p>

<p>&sect;13 Work done by Davis and Vanderslise [<script>crossref(5)</script>]
suggested that the distribution of energies to be dependent of cathode fall
length and the mean free path for exchange collision.� </p>

<p>&sect;14 In the primary ionic state for
triode systems the relationship between the mean free path,
&#955;, and charge collision
is given by </p>

<p>���&#955; = 1/ n&sigma;���� ---------------- ( 1 )</p>

<p>� &sigma;� = collision cross section</p>

<p>�n = number density of the gas</p>

<p>&sect;15 In their analysis they made
four assumptions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All ions originate in the
negative glow</li>
  <li>In a charge exchange
collision, an energetic ion interacts with its neutral counterpart, producing
an equally energetic neutral and an ion with zero energy</li>
  <li>The collision cross-section
for charge transfer is independent of incident energy</li>
  <li>The electric field decreases
linearly from the cathode to the edge of the negative glow</li>
</ul>

<p>&sect;16 The modification of the above
model by Rickards [<script>crossref(6)</script>] gave a more general form which enabled field
distributions other than the linear case to be considered. </p>

<p>&sect;17 The following equation defines
the number of ions per energy interval as:-</p>

<p>dN/dE = (N<sub>o</sub>/m) (L/&#955;)
(1-E) <sup>(1/m) -1</sup>  exp{ - L/&#955; + L/&#955;
(1-E) <sup>1/m</sup> } ------- ( 2 )</p>

<p>E= ion energy relative to the
maximum (this lies between 0 and 1.)</p>

<p>L = Cathode Fall Length</p>

<p>N<sub>o</sub> = number of ions
entering the cathode fall region from the negative glow.</p>

<p>&#955; = Mean free path for
charge-exchange collision</p>

<p>&sect;18 When m = 2 the equation is
equivalent to the Davis and Vanderslice model [<script>crossref(5)</script>].</p>

<p>&sect;19 According to the work by
Matthew et al [<script>crossref(7)</script>] when m equals to 4/3 the value corresponds to the
more realistic space charge limited (free-fall) case, the value of m chosen has
minimal effect on the distribution shape. The value of L/&#955;
influences the distribution shape. A reduction of L/&#955; produces an energy
spectrum in which a greater proportion of the ions have energies nearer the
maximum. Similarly, by decreasing the value of L/&#955; the energies of ions
could be controlled near to the minimum level. This control helps to change the
film formation and growth process.</p>

<p>&sect;20 Chapman  [<script>crossref(8)</script>] has shown
that L can be calculated, knowing the current density, by using the free-fall
version of the Child-Langmuir equation.</p>

<p>L = (4E<sub>o</sub>/9J)<sup>1/2</sup>
(2q/M)<sup>1/4</sup> V<sup>3/4� </sup>-------------------------
(3)</p>

<p>J= Cathode current density</p>

<p>Q= Ionic charge</p>

<p>M = Ion mass</p>

<p>V= Bias Cathode Voltage</p>

<p>E<sub>o</sub> = Permitivity of
free space</p>

<p>&sect;21 This above equation has been
derived for situations where the cathode is bombarded on one face only, which
is flat and infinitely large. The ions originate from the negative glow with an
initial energy of zero. The work done by Matthew et al [<script>crossref(7)</script>] to test the
validity of this equation showed differences when compared with the results of
other researchers  [<script>crossref(9)</script>]. Although all data showed good precision the
accuracy was not comparable. In addition they have also commented about the
possible inaccuracy (about 10%) due to secondary electron current density which
was ignored in those experiments.</p>

<p>&sect;22 Where different gas pressures
have been used e.g. higher pressures, the mobility limiting effects could be
expected to become important. An alternative equation developed by Grass-Marti
et al  [<script>crossref(10)</script>] have taken into account of intermediate situations between
the free-fall and mobility limited regimes. Yet, Matthews et al  [<script>crossref(7)</script>]
have stated that this equation did not prove their model to have any greater
applicability than the free-fall Child �Langmuir equation. Their work further
proved that Davis and Vanderslice assumption of sigma is independent of energy
to be untrue. Sheldon�s [<script>crossref(11)</script>] predictive equation for sigma and
Hegerberg and co-workers  [<script>crossref(12)</script>] data have been proved to be more
reliable. In this project the HEPAP process was studied as a total system with
no controlled ionic states. Hence we have attempted to consider all possible
occurrence during the HEPAP subject to following assumptions.</p>

<p>&sect;23 Although previous work showed
HEPAP to yield better results than conventional systems under low temperature
and low pressures, this did not produce the best results with high precision.
We attempted to run the HEPAP process within the theoretical model given below.
This included several assumptions and extensions to already suggested mechanisms. [<script>crossref(13)</script>]
</p>

<h4>�<b>The assumptions involved in
the theoretical model</b></h4>

<p>&sect;24 1) We have considered Rickards
equation where m= 4 / 3 to have a minimum effect on the distribution shape. [<script>crossref(6)</script>]</p>

<p>&sect;25 2) L/&#955; is considered to have a
critical influence on the distribution. [<script>crossref(5)</script>]</p>

<p>&sect;26 3) Mobility limiting factor to
be minimal in HEPAP process where the pressure range was less than 100 mPa. [<script>crossref(8)</script>]</p>

<p>&sect;27 4) The effect of the secondary
electrons to the ion current density to be 10% of the total as reported in
previous studies. [<script>crossref(7)</script>] </p>

<p>&sect;28 5) Neutral energy distributions
to be displaced to lower energies than that for ion energy distributions. [<script>crossref(7)</script>]</p>

<p>&sect;29 6) There is no interaction
between Ar and N<sub>2</sub>   gases. [<script>crossref(7)</script>] </p>

<p>&sect;30 7) Ionisation efficiency to be
more effective as an indicator or ions arriving at the cathode. [<script>crossref(7)</script>] </p>

<p>&sect;31 8) The total E<sub>t</sub> = E<sub>letn</sub>
+ E<sub>hen</sub> + E<sub>ions </sub> [<script>crossref(14)</script>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>E<sub>t</sub> = total energy</p>

<p>E<sub>letn</sub> = Low Energy
Thermal Neutrals</p>

<p>E<sub>hen </sub>= High Energy
Neutrals</p>

<p>E<sub>ions� </sub>= Energetic Ions</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&sect;32 9) The N<sub>2</sub> gas could
exist in any of the following forms given below.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Activity of total Nitrogen =
Activity (N<sub>2 </sub>+N<sup>.</sup> + N<sup>+</sup> +N<sup>2+</sup>)</p>

<p>Yet, N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>
state to be more dominant ionic species [<script>crossref(15)</script>] and the dissociative
charge transfer to be less likely because of the short L. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&sect;33 10) The electronic configurations of aluminium and nitrogen are as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Al = Atomic number 13 :- 1s<sup>2</sup>
2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup> 3s<sup>2</sup>sp<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>N = Atomic number 7 :- 1s<sup>2</sup>
2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>�� </p>

<p>In order to form aluminium
nitride, the aluminium and nitrogen reaction has to cross the energy barrier.
According to the results of previous work [<script>crossref(11)</script>] the two possible forms
of aluminum nitride coatings recorded have been AlN and Al<sub>3</sub>N. </p>

<p>L= Thickness of the layer</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&sect;35 12) Overall pressure to represent
the pressure at the cathode</p>

<p>&sect;36 In our work where a triode as
opposed to a traditional diode was used, the following was clearly highlighted.</p>

<p>&sect;37 The IPAP has become a triode by
the simple fact that the system includes a thermionic negative element. Hence,
this being the only change, it is correct to assume that the results obtained
have been influenced by this factor alone. In extending our understanding of
the system the obvious mechanism could be described as follows:- </p>

<ul>
  <SCRIPT>comment(38)</SCRIPT><li>This process is activated by the energy supplied to the
system and increases with the cathode voltage. An increase in the cathode
voltage increases the number of ions with in the system. This means the number
of nitrogen ions in the cathode surface increases. Therefore an increase in the
cathode voltage increases the degree of ionisation in the plasma. When the
chamber pressure is decreased whilst the cathode current density is kept
constant, an increase in the ions near the cathode surface can be expected.</li>
  <SCRIPT>comment(39)</SCRIPT><li>Therefore we have tested a system whereby independently
changing the cathode voltage, cathode current density and chamber pressure we
have managed to achieve desirable effects on increasing the number of high
energy particles near the surface.</li>
  <SCRIPT>comment(40)</SCRIPT><li>Hence as explained in the equations 1 and 2 the
relationship among the energy distribution in the system and the mean free path
for ionising collisions and the cathode fall length is affected by the changes
to the afore mentioned parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>&sect;41 The total energy at each stage
was calculated by combining equations 2 and 3.</p>

<p>&sect;42 Bearing the above factors in
mind, one can extend the above equations, to receive the average ion energy as
follows:- </p>

<p>E<sub>i</sub><sup>a</sup>
= E<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup>/N<sub>0</sub> = V<sub>c</sub> [ 2 (&#955;
/L) � 2(&#955;
/L) + 2(&#955; /L)e<sup>-L/</sup><sup>&#955;</sup> ]</p>

<p>Where m= 2, N<sub>0</sub> = Total
ions and neutrals and E<sub>i</sub><sup>a</sup> = average ion energy, E<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup> = Total
ions energy, N<sub>hen</sub> = number of high energy neutrals </p>

<p>&sect;43 The neutrals in the system can be
either high energy or low energy. The high energy neutrals gain energy by
collision with ions. </p>

<p>&sect;44 Therefore N<sub>hen</sub> = N<sub>0
</sub>(L/&#955;)</p>

<p>&sect;45 For High energy neutrals this
could be written as :-</p>

<p>E<sup>a</sup><sub>hen</sub>
= E<sup>t</sup><sub>hen</sub>/ N<sub>n</sub> </p>

<p>&sect;46 Then</p>

<p>E<sup>a</sup><sub>hen</sub>
= E<sup>t</sup><sub>hen </sub>/ N<sub>0 </sub>(L/&#955;) = V<sub>c</sub>  (&#955;
/L) [ 1-2 (&#955;
/L) + 2(&#955;
/L) - 2(&#955; /L)e<sup> L/&#955;</sup> ]</p>

<p>E<sup>a</sup><sub>hen</sub>
= average high energy neutrals, E<sup>t</sup><sub>hen</sub> = total high energy
neutrals, V<sub>c</sub> = cathode voltage</p>

<p>&sect;47 Hence the
dependency of L and &#955; is apparent and thus demands the correct setting up of the parameters in HEPAP.</p>

<p>&sect;48 The best results were obtained
when the system was running at the following parameters:-</p>

</div>

<p>&sect;49 For the energies below 880eV a
thinner nitride diffusion layer has been observed. [<script>crossref(8)</script>] Hence the total
energy had to be higher than this level. The calculations were made to ensure
that the total ion energy (without the neutral energy) was higher by increasing
the cathode voltage and cathode current density.� </p>

<p>&sect;50 If the cathode voltage is kept
constant, then for the same gaseous ions,</p>

<p>L = k. (1/ cathode current
density)<sup>1/2 </sup>--------------------- ( 4 )</p>

<p>&sect;51 Although our
experiments extended to higher cathode current densities and cathode voltages
that gave higher energy values, we did not see any major improvements. One
reason for this deviation could be the assumptions made in our theoretical
model. Nevertheless, it shows that continuous bombardment on the substrate
surface over a longer period at high cathode voltages seemed to have given the
back scattering effect thereby reducing the thickness of the layers. There
seemed to be an optimum level above which any increase will not show any
further improvement. This has been confirmed by other studies. [<script>crossref(7)</script>] </p>

<p>&sect;52 Another reason
will be the total number of bombarding particles. If the majority is thermal
neutrals then they will dilute the effect. This will need further investigations
using the ion efficiency.</p>

<p>&sect;53 Nevertheless,
the calculations of energies will enable to predict the parameters near to the
optimum levels.</p>

<p>&sect;55 Our experiments finally confirmed the following facts:-</p>

<ul>
  <SCRIPT>comment(56)</SCRIPT><li>Nitriding was feasible at low temperatures using IPAP.
The temperature was around 400 &deg;C</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(57)</SCRIPT><li>The plasma nitriding process was easily carried out
     at low pressures where as conventional system typically uses high
     pressures. </li>
  <SCRIPT>comment(58)</SCRIPT><li>IPAP showed higher ion efficiency and higher particle
energy in comparison with conventional DC diode plasma nitriding system.<br>
The ion efficiency is achieved through an increase of ions in the cathode fall
length. The thermionic emitter assists this process.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(59)</SCRIPT><li>A shorter processing time. We manage to show that
     after about two hours of processing time the IPAP reached the optimum
     level. This proves that IPAP is capable of reaching the optimum within a
     shorter period.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(60)</SCRIPT><li>Many materials can be nitrided this way where as
     the conventional methods will nitride only certain materials. The major
     reason for this is the higher temperatures applied in conventional system
     that make them unsuitable. </li>
</ul>

<p>&sect;61 We suggest any of the following
two possibilities for the mechanism responsible for the formations of AlN.</p>

<p>&sect;62 The first possibility is the
formation of aluminium nitride in the plasma. This happens when active nitrogen
ions react with sputtered aluminium ions. Initially they will be high in
nitrogen (AlN) and upon condensation on to the surface of the cathode they
decomposes and release nitrogen. This nitrogen may diffuse in to the substrate.
Thus the composition becomes Al<sub>3</sub>N type. </p>

<p>&sect;63 The second possibility is that
ionic bombardment induces vacancies and vacancy clusters and therefore
increases nitrogen diffusion. This could generate a coating with a thickness of
few atomic layers and some may have defects. These defects will also promote
the diffusion of nitrogen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Suggested energy barriers involved in AlN
formation</h4>

<p>&sect;64 Hence our explanation is that
there are two possible energy barriers ( vide: above graphs) and depending on
the energy available the reaction path will vary. In normal conditions where
sufficient extra energy is provided AlN could be the predictive state. In an
environment such as IPAP, Al<sub>3</sub>N metastable would be more desirable
since the temperature will be comparatively lower and the continuous
bombardment support the nitrogen diffusion inwardly. </p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>&sect;65 Our experiments have shown that
IPAP system to be a feasible, low temperature deposition method for surface
coatings. A triode created by thermionic emitter showed a significant
improvement in deposition. Any comparisons with conventional systems will
further established the efficient and effective process development of IPAP
over other established methods. When aluminium substrates were exposed to IPAP
conditions, they showed a satisfactory growth of aluminium nitride with an
improved hardness. Although initial sputtering was useful in the removing oxide
layer the results were not satisfactory. One of the major aspects in aluminium
nitride coating was the cleaning. Our experiments showed, a significant
improvement was observed by the use of polished aluminium substrates. The
formed nitride layer did not show any further growth after reaching an optimum
level. The ability to control power independently for the emitter, the specimen
and the positive electrode facilitated the independent control of voltage and
cathode current density. The entire process was successfully completed at
temperature less than 400 &deg;C. Therefore, HEPAP would definitely be
an attractive process for coatings of temperature sensitive materials. The
theoretical model developed will assist to calculate the ion energies, which in
turn will give an indication of optimum parameters that, could be used. The
model will become more reliable as and when the assumptions are confirmed to
reflect ideal situations. This model could be now used for coatings of other
material using IPAP.</p>

<p>&sect;66 One of the draw back of IPAP was
the difficulty of controlling the thickness of the coating. The fact that the
nitride layers did not grow further than a certain limit due to shielding
effect of previous layers which in turn made it difficult to control the
thickness. The author suggest the supply of an extra source of substrate
material viz ; another aluminium disc, the substrate to be connected to a
rotating device or to supply an additional source of the substrate material in
powder form that will enable to enter the cathode fall region. </p>
