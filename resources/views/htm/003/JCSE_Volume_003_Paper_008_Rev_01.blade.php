<h3>&sect;1 <b>Abstract </b></h3>

<p>In this study the corrosion
behaviour of Mo and Mo containing (AISI type 316) and Mo free (AISI type
304)�� steels were comparatively
investigated. It was found that the passivation� of Mo starts at �550 mV (all
potentials are reported with respect to SCE) in basic and �1400 mV in acidic media.
The transpassive dissolution in both these media was found to take place at 400
mV. The addition of NaCl into the media�
causes the evolution of oxygen at 1700 mV. The anodic dissolution potential of Mo containing steel 316
was found to be 100 mV more anodic than non-Mo containing 304 steel.�
It was concluded that the passive layer of Mo consisted of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and MoO<sub>2</sub>. The metal undergoes to dissolution precipitation mechanism
in the transpassive dissolution region.�

<h3><b>Introduction
</b></h3>

  <p>&sect;2 The susceptibility of iron
against corrosion makes it necessary to be used in the form of stainless steel. The corrosion
resistance of steels is provided by a very thin oxide layer (passive film)
formed upon them. Although this layer readily dissociates in various media, it
quickly renews itself. The addition of elements such as Cr, Ni and Mo increases the corrosion resistance
of steels to a great extent. </p>

<p>&sect;3 Tomashov et al [<script>crossref(1)</script>]
observed that the elements such as Mo, Si, V and Re prevented the formation of
pitting corrosion in steels. Lizlovs and Bond [<script>crossref(2)</script>] proved that the
addition of Mo into high purity
stainless steel decreased their critical current densities. Rockel [<script>crossref(3)</script>] on
the other hand examined the effect of addition of Mo to Fe18-Cr steel and
reported that the Mo had a
significant effect in the anodic dissolution region but the effect of Mo in the
transpassivation region was not so big. Sugimoto and Sawada [<script>crossref(4)</script>] investigated the effect of
alloying elements in steels. They reported that there was no pitting corrosion
after the addition of Mo till the transpassive dissolution started and the
corrosion potential shifted to more anodic direction. The Mo content of the
passive film showed a linear increase with the Mo content of the steel. Lu et
al. [<script>crossref(5)</script>] investigated the behaviour of steel in a medium containing MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
and found that Mo present in the passive layer was both in 6+ (as [MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>
and MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and 4+ (as MoO<sub>2</sub>) oxidation states. It was proposed that MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> increased the corrosion
resistance of the passive film by two-pole action or rectification[<script>crossref(5)</script>]. </p>

<p>&sect;4 It was observed that the
formation of pitting is largely prevented in solutions containing 50 �100 mM
molybdate ions�[<script>crossref(9)</script>]-[<script>crossref(11)</script>]. In acidic
solutions molybdate ions forms polymolybdate as follows:</p>

<p>MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
+ H<sup>+ </sup><font face="Symbol">�</font> MoO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sup> -</sup></p>

<p>MoO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sup> -</sup>
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O <font face="Symbol"> �</font> MoO(OH)<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup></p>

<p>This ion then forms a
polymeric structure forming oxy bridges </p>

<p>2MoO(OH)<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup><font face="Symbol">�</font> [(HO)<sub>4</sub>OMo-O-MoO(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>+ H<sub>2</sub>O
</p>

<p>which have an important �role in the prevention of pitting . The
solubility products of the compounds formed by the oxy-ions of molybdate and
metal ions are very small. This forms a protective barrier against pitting. </p>

<p>&sect;5 Nishumura and Kudo[<script>crossref(6)</script>] concluded that the addition of
Mo decreases the number and/or the activity of the active sites upon the
surface and increases the resistance of�
AISI 304 and 316 steels against the corrosion . Hashimoto et al [<script>crossref(7)</script>]
gave the average structure of the surface film upon Fe-30Cr-2Mo steel as Fe(II)<sub>0.22
</sub>Fe(III)<sub>0.37</sub> Cr(IV)<sub>0.27</sub> Cl<sub>0.02 </sub>O<sub>1.36
</sub>(OH)<sub>0.46 </sub><b>. </b>0.61H<sub>2</sub>O.
According to Boucherit [<script>crossref(8)</script>] it was a FeMoO<sub>4 </sub>layer, which
prevents the pitting corrosion. Goetz and Landolt [<script>crossref(9)</script>] investigated the corrosion behaviour of pure Cr and its
alloys containing varying amounts of Mo and they observed that the active
dissolution peak decreased by the addition of Mo into Cr. The addition of Mo above %5 resulted in
the disappearance of dissolution peak. Mischler et al. [<script>crossref(10)</script>] stated
that Fe-Cr alloy was subjected to pitting corrosion in acidic media while Fe-Cr-mo
alloys displayed no such phenomenon. Olefjord [<script>crossref(11)</script>] reported that in
acidic media there was a� formation
of� a very thick layer of MoO<sub>3</sub>
but the protective ability of this layer was very low. Olefjord and Elfstr�m [<script>crossref(12)</script>] investigated the corrosion rates
of 21.7Cr-13.3Ni-3.6Mo (steel 1)
and 18.7Cr-11.7Ni-1.7Mo(steel 2) steel and pure Cr, Fe, Ni and Mo and
determined the following order: i<sub>Cr</sub> &gt;i<sub>Fe</sub>&gt; i<sub>Ni</sub>&gt; i<sub>steel 1</sub> &gt;i<sub>steel
2</sub>&gt;i<sub>Mo� .</sub>Kodama and
Ambrose [<script>crossref(13)</script>] concluded that molybdate ions caused the repassivation of
Fe and prevented the formation of pitting. According to Stout� et al.[<script>crossref(14)</script>] molybdate ions form a
protective chemisorbed or salt film. Yang et al. [<script>crossref(15)</script>] reported that
the molybdate ions form a protective layer of FeMoO<sub>4</sub> and repassivate
the steel. Wanklyn [<script>crossref(16)</script>] on
the other hand claimed that the solid state reaction forming MoO<sub>2</sub>
upon the surface hinders the local corrosion. Schneider et al. [<script>crossref(17)</script>] examined the role of Mo ion in
Mo containing steels in acidic Cl<sup>-</sup>
containing media and claimed that the decreasing effect of Mo upon pitting
corrosion was due to the formation of highly insoluble molybdenum-chloride
compounds. </p>

<p>&sect;6 Molybdenum is used in wide range of fields ranging from
catalysis to dyes and corrosion inhibitors. The literature related to Mo is so
numerous : </p>

<p>&sect;7 Massing and Roth [<script>crossref(18)</script>] investigated the behaviour of Mo electrode in various media and
determined that the molybdates are highly insoluble in a medium with low
acidity. They also reported that Mo is resistant to HCl due to Mo<sup>5+</sup>
and Mo<sup>6+</sup> oxides formed upon its surface.</p>

<p>&sect;8 Besson and Drautzburg [<script>crossref(19)</script>] also
claimed that the surface of molybdenum is covered with coloured film of Mo<sup>6+</sup>
in both acidic and alkaline media. K�nig and G�hr [<script>crossref(20)</script>] determined
three potential regions for Mo in acidic media. According to these workers
there was hydrogen evolution in the first region with E &lt;-1.0 V(SCE) , the
formation of MoO<sub>2</sub> with the passage of a small current in the second
region ranging between �1.0 and 0.4 V(SCE) and the coverage of the surface with
a layer of MoO<sub>3</sub> with dissolution of MoO<sub>2</sub> in the third
region which ranged between 0.4 V to 4.0 V (SCE) with the passage of a
considerable anodic current. Wikstrom and Nobe [<script>crossref(21)</script>] found that the
capacitance of the first region was constant. They explained this phenomenon
with the coverage of the surface by MoO<sub>2</sub> in this region. Johnson et.
al.[<script>crossref(22)</script>] found that the Mo surface was rapidly covered with Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
in both acidic and basic media which subsequently oxidised to MoO<sub>3</sub>.
They claimed that MoO<sub>3</sub>
formed upon the surface is hydrolysed and dissolved as molybdate. Hull [<script>crossref(23)</script>]
determined that there were three oxide films [Mo(OH)<sub>3</sub>,MoO<sub>2</sub>,
MoO<sub>3</sub>] formed in basic and two oxide films (MoO<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>)
in acidic solutions </p>

<p>&sect;9 Sakashito and Sato [<script>crossref(24)</script>] investigated the ion selection
behaviour of MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> films. They found that the MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
hydrated Fe(II) membrane acts as a cation selector� in solution containing one valent cations and anion selector in
solution containing multi-valent cations. They claimed that the corrosion is
hindered under cation selective membranes. They called the membranes having
adsorbed multi-valent anions at one side and adsorbed cations at the
other,� �bipolarised� membranes.</p>

<p>&sect;10 The aim of this study is to
investigate the anodic dissolution and the corrosion behaviour of Mo and� the steels containing and not containing Mo
in� acidic and basic media using cyclic
voltammetry and comparing our findings with those given� literature. It is hoped that this work will
contribute to our understanding of the effects
of Mo on corrosion phenomena. </p>

<h3>Experimental
</h3>

  <p>&sect;11 There were four different
electrodes used in this study:  Fe (tempered at 1100&deg;C with a diameter
�of 0.3 mm and �a purity of 99.999%), AISI 304 ( with a
diameter of 0.5 cm) , AISI 316 ( with a diameter of 0.8 cm) and Mo ( with a
diameter of 1 mm). The Mo electrode
with a purity of 99.99% was obtained from Johnson &amp; Mathey Company. It was
mechanically cleaned and embedded in a polyester resin. The cylinder
shaped� steel electrodes (AISI 304 and 316) were bolted to brass rods, placed in Teflon and the gap between
  Teflon and
the steel was filled with polyester resin. The nominal compositions of AISI 304 and 316
steels are as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&sect;12 The reference and counter
electrodes were saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt plate with area of
1cm<sup>2</sup>. All the solutions were prepared with bi-distilled and
de-ionised water and analytical grade reagents.</p>

<p>&sect;13 The electrodes were
subjected to following mechanical, chemical and electrochemical pre-treatment
prior to each experiment: The electrodes were mechanically polished with emery
paper having various roughness in order to remove any oxide layer which may
form upon the electrode surface. They were then thoroughly washed with acetone
and bi-distilled water. They were finally placed into the cell�and&nbsp; kept at -600, -1000 and �1500 mV for fifteen minutes each in order
to eliminate anodic oxide films upon the surface. The solutions were purged
with purified N<sub>2</sub> throughout the experiments. The cyclic
voltammograms were taken with Wenking Model VSC72 voltage scan generator with a
scan rate of 1 mV/s .</p>

<h3>Results
and Discussion </h3>

<p>&sect;14 Figure 1 shows that the
highest dissolution peak for Fe electrode is observed in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
which decreases and shifts to more negative potentials in Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
There is no anodic dissolution peak observed in NaOH and the system goes
directly to the transpassive region.</p>

<p>&sect;16 Figure 2 shows the polarisation curves of
304 and 316 stainless steels in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The
anodic current observed around 1000 mV in 316 steel is due to the dissolution of
Mo<sup>6+</sup> species [<script>crossref(25)</script>]. Same increase in current was also
observed in 0.5 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and� attributed to the dissolution of Mo<sup>6+</sup> species as well (figure 3).</p>

  <p>&sect;19 The polarisation curves of 304 and 316
steels in NaOH (figure 4 ) revealed that Mo containing
316 steel started to dissolve at� 100 mV
more anodic than 304 steel. The
increase in the base concentration increases the Mo dissolution </p>

<p>&sect;21 When the cyclic voltammetric curves of Mo
in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is
examined (Figure 5) it is seen that the transpassive dissolution starts at �400
mV (SCE). The current passing at the transpassive region increases as the acid
concentration is increased. When the current goes above 600 mV (SCE) a black
layer formed upon the surface, which peels off with evolution of a gas. The
fact that there is no cathodic current passing below 400 mV in dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (Figure 6) was attributed to the reduction of
MoO<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>. In fact it was stated that the reduction of MoO<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>
ions takes place at potentials under 200 mV (SCE) [<script>crossref(16)</script>],[<script>crossref(26)</script>],[<script>crossref(27)</script>].</p>

<p>&sect;24 The effect of the Cl<sup>-</sup> ions
does not have a significant effect upon the shape of the curves but the initial
potential of the passivation� region
changes a lot. It was seen that the passivation� region starts at �1200 mV in the neutral NaCl solution (figure 7)
and at �550 mV in acidic solutions (Figure 8). The increase in the Cl<sup>-</sup>
concentration causes the peaks IIa and IIa<sup>*</sup> to become much more
distinctive and the oxygen evolution to take�
place (the black region with wild oscillations in Figure 9). </p>

<p>&sect;28 The effect of number of scans carried out
was displayed in Figure 8. There is a peak II<sub>1</sub> around 600 mV in the
first scan and the curve then reaches to the transpassive region. This peak
appears with the same magnitude but at more anodic potentials in the second
scan (II<sub>2</sub>).� There is only
one peak in the second scan, which corresponds to the potential where there was
the highest current density in the first scan (i.e. peak II<sub>3</sub>). It is
clear that there is a formation of a less soluble layer upon the electrode
after the first scan.</p>

<p>&sect;29 The appearance of peaks IIa and IIa<sup>&prime;</sup>
and the disappearance of IIa in the second scan is indicative of a film with
good covering properties. Therefore, there is formation of highly
insoluble� Mo-O-Cl or Mo-Cl layers
mentioned by Stout et al.[<script>crossref(14)</script>] . The increase of Cl<sup>- </sup>species
causes the big oscillations resulting from O<sub>2</sub> evolution (Figure 9) </p>

The effect of addition of NaCl on the anodic behaviour of Mo in basic
  media.</b></p>

<p>&sect;31 The figures 10 and 11 show that the
addition of NaCl to the reaction medium does not change the general appearance
and the transpassive dissolution potentials of Mo. Therefore the dissolution
phenomenon is not dependent very much�
upon the pH of the media. All these potentials are in perfect compliance
with those given in literature [<script>crossref(9)</script>],[<script>crossref(22)</script>],</sup> [<script>crossref(27)</script>].</p>

The effect of addition of NaCl upon the anodic behaviour of Mo in acidic media.</b> </p>

<p>&sect;33 The behaviour of Mo electrode in basic
solutions is displayed in Figure 12. In alkaline solution the transpassive
dissolution starts at �200 mV. The
low valent oxide formed at cathodic potentials converts into high valent one as
the potential is taken to more anodic values. as
the NaOH concentration is increased it is seen that the peak Ia increases and
IIa and IIa*
decrease. There is a linear relation between the current density of peak Ia and
NaOH concentration which indicates that the reaction is controlled by the
diffusion of OH<sup>-</sup> ions . The dissolution takes place as HMoO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in acidic
and as MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in basic media [<script>crossref(23)</script>],[<script>crossref(28)</script>]. The peaks
IIIg, IIg and Ig observed in the reverse scan become more apparent as the NaOH
concentration is increased. The increase in NaOH concentration causes the
anodic dissolution dominate to film formation. In concentrated NaOH solution
the transpassive dissolution potential is seen to shift to
more cathodic values.
This potential which is �160 mV in 0.1 M NaOH�
shifts to �450 mV in 4M NaOH solution. In concentrated alkaline solution
the pores of the films get larger and Mo dissolves as MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
through those pores [<script>crossref(29)</script>]. All the phenomena in the anodic region take
place through dissolution- precipitation mechanism. </p>

  <p>&sect;35 The effect of addition of NaCl to NaOH
solution is displayed in Figure 13. The hydrogen evolution region obtained in
these media corresponds to IIIa peak in pure NaOH solutions. The increase in NaOH concentration causes the disappearance of IIIa peak. peak
  Ia* is only observed in solutions with
  the addition of 3 M NaCl and 5 M NaCl. This peak is related to the formation of Mo<sup>5+</sup>
species since MoO(OH)<sub>3</sub> or Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O
do not dissolve in alkaline solution.</p>

<p>&sect;37 In all the solutions containing H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HCl, NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NaOH
there is a rapid dissolution starting from 400 mV. The basic film protecting
the surface in the passive region is MoO<sub>2</sub>, which converts into less
protective Mo<sup>6+</sup> film in the transpassive region. There is both a
dissolution of Mo as Mo<sup>6+</sup> ions and the partial coverage of the
surface with less protective layer of MoO<sub>3</sub> at the same time till the
potential of peak IIa is reached in accordance to the dissolution-precipitation
reaction [<script>crossref(23)</script>] ,[<script>crossref(30)</script>].</p>

  <p>&sect;38 Figure 14 shows that the
excessive instability in current corresponds to the O<sub>2</sub> evolution
region in the media having high NaCl concentration. This phenomenon is not observed at low NaCl concentrations.
It is also seen that the increase in NaCl concentration decreases the cathodic
limiting current density at 2400 mV. This indicates that the film becomes much
more protective.� Lu and Clayton [<script>crossref(28)</script>] claimed that there occurs Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
MoO<sub>2</sub> and MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub> in the passive region ranged between �180 mV and 600mV. In
  the transpassive region Mo is dissolved as HMoO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>.
  In other
words there is the formation of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>2</sub>
and MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub> in the passive region ranging up to 600 mV and the
formation of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and MoO<sub>3</sub> above this
potential. In this region the metal undergoes dissolution �precipitation as
outlined above. The MoO<sub>3</sub> layer formed as a result of this mechanism
gives peak IIa as it gets thicker. The metal also dissolves as HMoO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> up to peak
IIa� (Figure 13 ). The sharp decrease in the current density after peak IIa
shows that the surface is covered with highly insoluble Mo-Cl and Mo-O-Cl type
compounds [<script>crossref(17)</script>], [<script>crossref(28)</script>]. </p>

<p align="center">&sect;39 <b>Figure 14 The effect of NaCl concentration upon the anodic behaviour of Mo
in 0.1 M HCl.</b></p>

<p>&sect;40 Povey and Metcalfe [<script>crossref(30)</script>] argued that the passive region is mainly consisted of
Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Mo(OH)<sub>3</sub>
type oxides . They proved that there was a formation of MoO<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sup>3+</sup> and Mo<sup>4+</sup> at
the potential where transpassivation starts and the amount of Mo<sup>6+</sup>
increased above this potential </p>

<p>&sect;41 Hull [<script>crossref(23)</script>] on� the other hand claimed
that the first wave is related to the formation of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
or Mo(OH)<sub>3</sub> , the
second wave is due to MoO<sub>2</sub> and the third wave results from the
formation of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> or non stoichiometric oxides . </p>

<p>&sect;42 This study revealed that Mo stays passive
in a large potential range in basic media starting from �1200 mV. Since IIa
peak in acidic media is due to the formation of Mo<sup>6+</sup> species , the
peak Ia observed in basic media must be due to the conversion of MoO<sub>2</sub>
into MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Habazaki et al (1992) [<script>crossref(31)</script>] showed that there was a dissolution peak of Mo between �400
and �200 mV. The absence of this peak in our study can be attributed to the
fact that the cathodic current (H<sub>2</sub>
evolution) is much bigger than the anodic dissolution. The peak given by
Habazaki [<script>crossref(31)</script>] corresponds
to peak Ia in basic media. </p>

<p>&sect;43 Figure 15 compares the polarisation
behaviour of Mo and 316 steel in 0.05 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 3 M NaCl.
It is seen that the passive region of 316 steel corresponds to the anodic
dissolution Mo. The O<sub>2</sub> evolution region in Mo on the other hand is
the region where 316 steel goes into transpassive dissolution.</p>

<p>&sect;45 The transpassive dissolution takes place
at 0.9 V in both 304 and 316 steels. The active dissolution potential of Cr is around �800 mV. The
passivation� potential of Mo on the
other hand is �50 mV, which shows a decrease in the active dissolution
potential of steel. Cr and Mo oxides together protect the surface up to the
transpassivation� potential of Mo. Since
the transpassive dissolution potential
of both steels is the same (0.9 V) the main
protection must be provided by Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The selective
dissolution of Fe in the
transpassive region makes the protective layer rich in Cr and the steel behaves as high Cr steel which are highly
resistant against the corrosion. The main function of Mo in the protection of
steels is that the formation of MoO<sub>2</sub> and MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub>
covering the defects upon the surface. According to Schneider et al. there is a formation of Mo-Cl salts at
the bottom of the pits which are highly insoluble and cannot be washed away [<script>crossref(17)</script>].
</p>

<p>&sect;46 The results of this study are the
following: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
The
passivation� region of the Mo electrode, subjected to cathodic pretreatment at-1500 mV, starts at �550 mV. The
transpassive dissolution takes place at 400 mV.
The transpassive dissolution region in both H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
is the same.</li>
    <li>
In
HCl solutions passivation� starts at
�550 mV and the transpassive dissolution takes place at potentials higher than
400 mV. The transpassive dissolution manifests itself as peaks IIa and IIa�.
The general shape of the curves obtained in NaCl solutions is the same but the
initiation of passivation is shifted to �1100 mV.</li>
    <li>
The
behaviour of Mo in NaOH solutions
however is different than those obtained in acidic media. In alkaline media
there occurs peaks Ia and IIIa in addition to peak IIa observed in acidic
solutions. The peaks IIa and IIIa merge and the peak Ia decreases as the
concentration of NaOH is
increased.</li>
    <li>
The
addition of NaCl in all the media investigated caused the increase in peak IIa
and decrease in peak Ia. The increase in the concentration of NaCl added
resulted in O<sub>2</sub> evolution around 1700 mV with manifestation of wild
oscillation in current. The magnitude of current observed in the second
passivation� region at 2300 mV changed
in the order of 0.1 M HCl &lt; 0.1 M HCl + 3.0 M NaCl &lt; 0.1 M NaOH + 3.0 M
NaCl &lt; 0.05 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 3.0 M NaCl &lt;&lt;
3.0 M NaCl. This indicates
that the precipitation of 6+ valent Mo-Cl, Mo-O-Cl or Mo-OH-Cl at peak IIa had
a protective effect upon the surface.</li>
    <li>
The
passivation� in the passive region is
the result of very thin Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MoO<sub>2</sub>. the transpassive dissolution starts at
peak Ia with the formation of MoO(OH)<sub>2</sub> . The peak IIa� observed
after the addition of NaCl is due to the formation of Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
The increase in current between IIa� and IIa is due to the dissolution of the
film as HMoO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>
in the acidic and MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
in the basic media and the coverage of the surface with MoO<sub>3</sub> film
which has poor protective qualities. The peak IIa is the result of the coverage
of the surface with MoO<sub>3</sub> film.</li>
    <li>
When
the corrosion behaviour of AISI 304 and 316 steels are compared it is observed
that 316 steel dissolves more than 304 steel at the transpassive dissolution
potential of� -900 mV. this is due to rapid dissolution of Mo
in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>solutions.
The selective dissolution of Fe in steels makes the surface rich in Mo, which
dissolves as HMoO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>
or MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. these
ions act as inhibitor and repair the damaged oxide film upon the surface. The adsorption of MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>
ions on to the surface forms a double pole membrane upon it, which prevents Cl<sup>-</sup>
ions reaching the surface. Also the formation of highly insoluble O-Cl,
Mo-OH-Cl or Mo-O-Cl compounds
formed at the bottom of the pits increase the protective effect of the oxide
film.</li>
