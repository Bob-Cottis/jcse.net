<h3>&sect;1 Abstract</h3>

<p>Zinc metal containing coatings, especially those based on
silicate binders are very popular anti-corrosive primers. This review explores
the history of their discovery, compares them with more conventional organic
systems, and discusses the proposed mechanisms of cure. The protection
mechanisms are summarised and specific features such as minimum zinc content
are emphasised. Recent electrochemical studies are examined and the various
models are discussed. </p>

<p><b>Keywords: </b>metallic zinc powder, silciate binder, epoxy binder, review,
cure mechanisms, protection mechanisms </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>Early developments</h4>

<p>&sect;2 The extraction of zinc was first carried out commercially in
Bristol in 1743. As part of the process, powdered zinc oxide was obtained by
roasting sulphide ores which was then reduced by distillation with carbon. Thus
early on in the history of zinc, both zinc oxide and zinc metal were available
in a finely divided form and the use of these materials in paints is a natural
extension. Before the rise in rutile titania as an opacifying pigment, zinc
oxide was very popular. It is still used in can lacquers for the containing of
proteinaceous products. Sulphur containing proteins cause black staining with
the iron of the can. Fortunately zinc zulphide is colourless. Zinc phosphate
dihydrate is currently popular as an anti corrosion primer pigment. Zinc metal
powder has always been readily available as zinc is produced by condensation
from the vapour and it has a long history as a pigment is paints. According to
Nelson writing in volume 2 of the classic five volume series edited by
Mattiello <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>
zinc dust pigments have been used since 1840 with very early French and German
work quoted in his article. According to Munger, the use of metallic zinc in
paint coatings for the protection of steel from corrosion dates back to the
1930�s <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>.
These coatings, with a high quantity of zinc included, are used as a primer or
final coat and can be spray applied, dipped or brushed.</p>

<p>&sect;3 The scientific developments of these coatings, predominantly
organic, which contain zinc in high quantities started in Cambridge in the
1940's with Evans &amp; Mayne<a name="_Ref521129880"></a> <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>. This early work incorporated 95% by
weight of zinc into a variety of binders. These included chlorinated rubber
lacquer, polystyrene lacquer, linseed oil, medium stand-oil, and an aqueous
emulsion of linseed oil. Panels were exposed into seawater with a scratch line
in the coating to expose steel. Evans &amp; Mayne explain the excellent
protection being due to the cathodically protective nature of the zinc. This in
part is due to the necessary particle to particle to substrate contact of the
zinc. Evans &amp; Mayne based the incorporation of zinc pigment on the original
work of sacrificial protection of iron or steel in seawater by Davy in 1834 <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>.
However, they also stated that paints pigmented with zinc dust had been
employed against atmospheric attack since the 1840�s <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>.
It was also found earlier that this type of paint gave temporary protection to
uncoated sections of a steel substrate in outdoor exposure <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;4 The first documented use of silicate binders is regularly
referred to be the application of a water-borne sodium silicate zinc dust
coating to the Morgan Wyalla above ground pipeline in Australia <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>.
The coating was cured with the heat and was reported to be in excellent
condition after more than 50 years<a name="_Ref521129197"></a> <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>.</p>

<h4>Zinc silicate coatings </h4>

<p>&sect;5 It is said by Munger<a name="_Ref521128922"></a> <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> that the entire development of zinc
silicate coatings began with the Australian, Victor Nightingall�s dream of
forming a zinc coating that would be the equivalent of galvanising but be
applied by painting techniques. His starting point was to produce a material
similar to the mineral willemite (zinc silicate, Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>)
as a thin film on a metal surface. It was said that the produced material was a
durable and corrosion resistant coating<a name="_Hlt521139698"></a> <a href="#_edn9">[9]</a>.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of zinc-rich coatings</h3>

<p>&sect;6 Coatings that are pigmented with zinc particles can have an
organic or inorganic binder. Organic binders such as epoxies, phenoxies,
chlorinated rubbers, silicones and vinyls have been used<a name="_Hlt521224868"></a>
<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>. Inorganic binders are either sodium
silicates or ethyl silicates. The inorganic binders can be self-curing and
water or solvent reducible.</p>

<p>&sect;7 Inorganic zinc silicate coatings are often used as primers
and are top coated with paints that do not contain zinc.</p>

<h3>Organic and inorganic zinc coatings</h3>

<p>&sect;8 The differences between organic and inorganic zinc coatings
have been summarised by Hafford et al <a
href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>.
It is said that organic zinc coatings are more compatible with topcoats, more
flexible, less dependant on atmospheric moisture to cure but are difficult to
apply under high or low ambient temperatures. With inorganic zinc coatings it
is said that the surface preparation is more rigorous, there is better
corrosion protection, better toughness and better abrasion resistance than is
seen with organic zinc coatings. Inorganic zinc coatings also dry faster under
optimum conditions and once the coating is formed there is better temperature
resistance.</p>

<p>&sect;9 O�Connor and Bowen<a name="_Ref521129129"></a> <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> give the advantages of both organic
and inorganic zinc coatings. These can be seen in table 3.</p>

<h3>Formation of zinc rich coatings</h3>

<p>&sect;10 Hare<a name="_Ref521129165"></a> <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> compares the film forming
characteristics of both organic and inorganic zinc rich coatings. It is stated
that the morphology and structure of organic and inorganic zinc rich films are
different especially with regard to the early stages of film formation. The
film formation chemistries include dehydration, neutralisation, solvent loss or
hydrolysis of the primary vehicle and silication with the zinc pigment. Authors
such as Munger<a name="_Ref521129087"></a> <a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> have detailed reactions that include
ionic zinc within the reaction mechanism. This is in some way backed up with
unpublished data of a �zinc� silicate coating with 0% zinc content. This
coating was unable to cure <a href="#_edn14"
name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;11 Hare<a name="_Hlt521225108"></a> <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> goes on to present a stylistic representation of
postulated structure of inorganic zinc-rich film. It shows how silicate vehicle
is bonded to zinc atoms on particles of zinc dust pigment.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1 � Postulated structure of inorganic zinc rich film
by Hare <script>crossref(12)</script></b></p>

<p>&sect;12 The stated advantages of this system are given as there
being no encapsulation by the binder, the film being porous to allow ingress of
electrolyte. There is also good film strength, adhesion, electrical
conductivity and cathodic protection.</p>

<h3>Cure of coating</h3>

<p>&sect;13 Coatings of this type that are two-pack solvent borne
usually require no further treatment to attain cure. The cure reaction proceeds
after the mixing of the two packs. This mixing initiates the chemical reaction
that enables the coating to dry and cure forming a film of desired properties.
There is a short, finite pot life of the coatings once mixing has occurred.
Two-pack coatings can be formulated with current and proposed environmental,
health and safety standards including volatile organic compound (VOC)
regulations <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"
title="">[15]</a>. These
changing regulations have lead to a move towards low VOC containing coatings
with solvents such as water. Typically these contain the pigment and solvent in
one part and the binder and solvent in the other part along with a small amount
of water and acid, either HCl or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The reaction
mechanism is suggested as that in figure 2.</p>

<p align="center"><img width=499 height=436
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image004.gif" hspace=12></p>

<p align="center">&sect;14 <b>Figure 2 � Cure reaction
of inorganic zinc silicate coatings based on tetraethylorthosilicate <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>,
<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;15 Byrnes &amp; Vincent<a name="_Ref521129511"></a> <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> state that there are two stages of
formation with ethyl silicate binders, these being: solvent evaporation, where
a firm dry film is formed that is able to tolerate mechanical handling; and
atmospheric moisture reacting with the ethyl silicate binder in hydrolysis,
releasing ethanol.</p>

<p>&sect;16 Eccleston<a name="_Ref521129400"></a> <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> however, goes further into the
complex reaction mechanism stating the reaction processes as being hydrolysis,
condensation and solvent evaporation. Although both authors vary in the amount
of detail in which the reaction mechanism is discussed, they both agree that
the end result is the zinc particles are bound to each other and the substrate
by inorganic silicates. The reaction mechanism of Eccleston is shown in figure
3.</p>

<p align="center"><img border=0 width=555 height=439
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image006.gif"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;17 <b>Figure 3 � Cure reaction mechanism proposed by Eccleston</b></p>

<p>&sect;18 Before the reaction takes place the material is
prehydrolised to a known degree by adding a small, exact amount of water. The
solution is also slightly acidic, as stated earlier. The alkoxy group goes to
silanol groups with alcohol in the hydrolysis reaction. Along with this alcohol
there is the alcohol in the bulk mixing solution, which begins to evaporate on
application. As the zinc is added the acid is neutralised making the silanol
groups more reactive, they then either react with each other to form the silica
matrix and water; or react with ethoxy groups to produce ethanol. The water
produced in the condensation reaction goes on to promote further hydrolysis.</p>

<p>&sect;19 It must be remembered that the above reactions can continue
after the coating appears to be dry. It is therefore important to understand
the rate of cure before any of the coatings can be either exposed or
over-coated. This is illustrated in figure 4, which features a time-line
representation by Ginsberg<a name="_Ref521129305"></a> <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>. </p>

<p align="center">&sect;20 <b>Figure 4 � Representation of the changing composition of the
coating with time <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;21 As the above figure illustrates, and the various authors
<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>,
<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>, <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>,
<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> confirm, the greatest changes in the formation
of the coating take place in the initial stages after the coating has been
applied. Therefore the conditions in which the application takes place can have
a significant effect on the film formation. This is an area studied by
Eccleston <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> who developed a gas chromatography method
for the analysis of cure.</p>

<p>&sect;22 Eccleston <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> states that zinc silicate coatings can be
touch dry in minutes and are resistant to rain within half an hour. This
compares well with water-borne alkali silicates that become resistant to rain
in approximately 24 hours. Differing conditions can lead to premature coating
failure. Application conditions that lead to failure are known either
qualitatively or anecdotally, such as application under low humidities. It is
not uncommon in the coating industry to spray the freshly coated substrate with
water when the humidity is low as under conditions of less than 40%RH the
coating will not cure <a href="#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>.
Although as part of the investigation by Eccleston <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> showed, the spraying with water is at its
most effective while the coating is still wet.</p>

<p>&sect;23 The assessment of cure has been subject to different
analytical techniques <a href="#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a>, <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>.
These include infra-red spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear magnetic reasonance
spectroscopy (NMR). Both Byrnes &amp; Vincent <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a>
and Eccleston <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> have each developed a gas chromatographic
method of analysis for the cure analysis. Byrnes &amp; Vincent utilised the
ethanol eluent peak to characterise the amount of cure. As figure 3 shows, the
ethanol is liberated from the first stage of the condensation reaction and as
time continues this should reduce as the cure becomes more complete. Byrnes
&amp; Vincent took four different brands of zinc rich silicate coatings and used
them in analysis, the results of which can be seen in figures 5 &amp; 6.</p>

<p>&sect;26 The result of the testing show that there are different
rates of cure for the samples used and that total hydrolysis is not needed for
solvent resistivity. However, it is unclear as to whether there were any individual
manufacturer specifications for the application of these coatings and if they
were followed. There is a clear correlation between the GC technique and the
MEK double rub sensitivity test <a href="#_edn22"
name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>&sect;27 Eccleston <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> used a GC technique to investigate the
various conditions that can prevail during the initial application stages.
Using an alkoxy:silicon ratio (from eluent peaks) analysis was completed at
different times and relative humidities. The results can be seen in figures 7 &amp;
8.</p>

<p>&sect;30 From these results Eccleston concludes:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><li>That
     the atmospheric conditions in the initial period after coating application
     is critical to the film formation and it is strongly influenced by
     temperature and humidity.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><li>Zinc
     dust accelerates the hydrolysis and cure is rapid.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT><li>The
     water produced in the condensation reaction goes on to hydrolyse 40% of
     the alkoxy groups, and at low %RH the water quickly evaporates and is not
     available for further hydrolysis. Also as an increase in temperature will
     cause both water and solvent to evaporate more quickly and the film will
     have less time to complete its reactions.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT><li>Hot
     &amp; dry conditions should be avoided during application and drying
     (water could be sprayed onto the coating before it becomes dry). Hot
     conditions alone are not too detrimental unless accompanied by a low %RH.</li>
</ul>

<p>&sect;35 This section has discussed the chemical reactions involved
in the formation of the dry coating film in the cure process and the idea that
zinc is involved within the reactions. At this point, there has been no mention
of the role of the steel substrate within the film forming process. Chemical
bonds are desirable for adhesion between the coating and substrate<a
name="_Ref521129905"></a> <a href="#_edn23"
name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a>. It is stated by Munger<a

the silica matrix to an iron atom located at the steel substrate surface, are
present at the coating/substrate interface (figure 9). Although supporting data
is not presented.</p>

<h3>The protection mechanism of zinc rich coatings</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>&sect;37 It is stated a number of times within this document that the
majority of the available literature concerns zinc rich coatings. Very little
is available on low-level zinc containing ethyl silicate coatings aside from
authors <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a>, <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> concluding that this type of coating does not
afford any protection to steel. The mechanisms and investigations into them
that appear in this section are almost all concerning zinc rich coatings. The
use of this information forms the basis of understanding to the performance
data that will be obtained for the subject coating.</p>

<h4>Comments on the protection mechanism</h4>

<p>&sect;38 Although there is a general agreement of there being two stages
in the protection mechanism, there appears to be most discussion on the type of
secondary effect. The type of literature that appears comes in the form of
either reviews or experimental papers. Occasionally review papers do include
original experimental work but with others the experience of the author with
the coating type may be simply of literature rather than practical. This
section includes comments by a number of authors, some of whom are very well
represented. Specific aspects of their work are discussed at a later stage;
initially it is the comments on the mechanism that are discussed here.</p>

<p>&sect;39 The above paragraph mentions a general agreement of the
mechanism with discussion concerning the second stage of protection. This is
opposed by Romagnoli &amp; Vetere <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> who state that there is not a universally accepted
theory for the protection mechanism. However, some agreement is with Evans
&amp; Mayne <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> who suggest a cathodic protection stage,
where the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode, followed by a subsequent stage
where the substrate is protected longer than is expected by galvanic action
alone. This is by either blocking of the pores within the coating by zinc
corrosion products; or the inhibitive action of zinc basic compounds on the
steel substrate. Experimental work carried out by Romagnoli &amp; Vetere <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> suggests zinc contents above 85% by weight
are needed for the particle-to-particle-to-substrate electrical contact. A
mention is also made of a 50% by weight zinc containing coating whereby the
authors dismiss this as being too low zinc content. As zinc content decreases
the protective action diminishes. Impedance work carried out suggests a pore
filling action by the zinc basic salts with properties dependant on particle
size and content of zinc.</p>

<p>&sect;40 It is stated by Hare <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> that the zinc rich type of coating is
sacrificial and that the galvanic activity is a consequence of a deliberately
engineered electrochemical cell (figure 11). The principles of this cell are
the same as those that form the basis of hot dip galvanising and anodes such as
zinc and magnesium. When there is no electrolyte (dry conditions or incidental,
light atmospheric wetting) Hare states that zinc corrosion is low and the steel
substrate is protected by the marginal barrier effects of the primer. The cell
is only active when electrolyte is present and when this is the case any
exposed steel is protected by a local cell action and is covered by zinc
corrosion product. Over time, according to Hare, the anode is polarised by zinc
corrosion products such as zinc carbonates, zinc sulphate and zinc hydroxide.
These products are said to fill the pores in the film structure forming a hard
inorganic film. The mechanism is then transformed from cathodic protection to a
barrier effect. Cathodic protection is said to be minimal after approximately 3
months and this lengthens to 3 years with atmospheric exposure. Hare concludes
that there remain questions concerning the barrier stage of protection.</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 width=541 height=212
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image020.gif"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;41 <b>Figure 10 � a) An Illustration of a simplified
electrochemical cell within the coating and b) Anode &amp; cathode reactions <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;42 According to Lindquist<a name="_Ref521135915"></a>
<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> the continued protection is related
to the inhibition of the steel by the basic zinc corrosion products within the
film and a locally raised pH. The zinc salts are formed due to the corrosion of
the zinc itself or due to the galvanic action. The influence of pH is also
mentioned by Ross &amp; Lingard<a name="_Ref521135391"></a> <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> who state that the pore blocking
mechanism is of greater importance than the galvanic stage. It is also stated
that the cathodic protection stage results in a high local pH, which protects
the steel and encourages the formation of insoluble, protective zinc compounds.</p>

<p>&sect;43 O�Connor &amp; Bowen <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> state that following the galvanic stage
the build up of corrosion product of zinc or �white rust� such as zinc
carbonate and zinc oxide fills the pores within the coating. This stops air and
moisture reaching the substrate below.</p>

<p>&sect;44 Scantlebury et al<a name="_Ref521135557"></a> <a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> agree that there is a galvanic stage
of protection but state that the second stage of protection is �contentious�.
Two suggested mechanisms are the corrosion products act as chemical inhibitors
or by blocking the pores. By a combination of monitoring current with time and
impedance it was concluded that the second stage of protection is a combination
between the two, i.e. zinc corrosion products acting as chemical inhibitors and
blocking pores. This is a point upon which Armas<a name="_Ref521135687"></a> <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> agrees where it is stated that the
main part of the mechanism is the cathodic protection of the steel by the zinc.
As the exposure time increases the deposition of inhibiting zinc compounds at
the base of the coating pores is followed by the sealing of the porous
structure by zinc corrosion products.</p>

<p>&sect;45 Feliu<a name="_Ref521129795"></a> <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a>,<a name="_Ref521135600"></a>
<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a> on work that utilises impedance for
both the galvanic and barrier stage states that the galvanic stage becomes
inactive after a short time. The second stage, it is said, is not sufficiently
classified and is dependant on zinc content. The ethyl silicate coatings of the
type studied by Feliu are said to favour cathodic protection.</p>

<p>&sect;46 Other authors<a name="_Ref521135420"></a> <a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a>, <a name="_Ref521135629"></a><a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a>, <a name="_Ref521129816"></a><a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>
agree that there is a galvanic stage
to the protection. The second stage follows what has already been stated in
this section where there is either a pore sealing or inhibiting barrier formed.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>&sect;47 It has been observed that there are many differences of
opinion within this subject area, but there are main underlying agreements.
These are summarised below:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <SCRIPT>comment(48)</SCRIPT><li>There
     are two stages in the mechanism of protection of high zinc content
     coatings. The first is the cathodic protection of the steel substrate by

<h4>Minimum zinc content for performance</h4>

<p>&sect;52 There are two types of information source that is found in
the literature: those who quote a minimum zinc content for the starting point
of cathodic protection and those who offer data of a minimum zinc content.� The minimum zinc content is of great
importance to this study because those quoted in the literature are invariably
much higher than that of the coatings that will be studied in this thesis.
Agreement between authors concerns the definition as to why there is a minimum
zinc content of the coatings. This it amount of zinc necessary for
particle-to-particle-to-substrate connectivity, which is discussed by Ross
&amp; Lingard <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> in terms of conductivity of the dry film.
It is stated that the conductivity is related to the zinc content, film
thickness and the internal resistance of the dried film when it comes into
contact with the electrolyte. Absolute values are shown in table 2.</p>

<h4>The performance of zinc-rich silicate coatings</h4>

<p>&sect;54 The monitoring of potential with time is one of the basic
techniques of corrosion science. It allows for a comparison between coating
systems and different research. Abreu et al <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a> have offered an explanation of the change
of potential with time in relation to zinc rich coatings. This is represented
as figure 11 below.</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 width=538 height=272
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image022.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;55 <b>Figure 11 � Evolution with immersion time of the corrosion
potential of a zinc rich paint/steel plate system <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;56 The periods (I, II &amp; III) are defined as follows:</p>

<p><b><i>Period I:</i></b> The corrosion potential shifts to more negative
values, towards the potential of zinc plate. There is a rapid initial stage,
due to the activation of the zinc particles in the coating, followed by
stabilisation at or near to the potential of zinc.</p>

<p><b><i>Period II: </i></b>The potential now begins to move towards the
protection potential of steel where the end of the cathodic protection stage is
reached. The process now transfers to the second stage of protection.</p>

<p><b><i>Period III: </i></b>The potential has passed the protection potential
of steel and is now moving towards the potential of iron. The coating surface
would now be beginning to show signs of iron rust.</p>

<p>&sect;57 Although the timescale may change there is a correlation
between the proposal detailed above and other data found within the literature.
What is clear is that the �activation� period that takes place initially is
often missed in the data collection process or the scales of the data axes are
not adjusted for its observation. Work completed by Armas <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> shows the behaviour of a zinc ethyl
silicate coating, at two different film thicknesses, on immersion in artificial
seawater when potential is monitored with time (figure 12)</p>

zinc containing epoxy coatings <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;59 It is clear from figure 12 that the film thickness has a
distinct effect on the performance of the coating when immersed. It also shows
that the ethyl silicate binder is more effective in this environment than the
epoxy type coating.</p>

<p>&sect;60 Scantlebury et al<a name="_Ref521135760"></a> <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a> monitored the corrosion potential of
a zinc rich ethyl silicate primer under immersion conditions in 3% sodium
chloride solution. The effect of a large bare area on the potential was also
monitored (figure 13)</p>

<p>&sect;61 Scantlebury <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a> described the coatings as a �Zinc particle coating
more or less surrounded by a �cement� of ethyl silicate�, and was applied to an
abrasively blasted panel with a film thickness of 50�10mm. The authors comment
that there is an insignificant amount of corrosion present after 33 months
outdoor exposure (Sines, Portugal). It can be seen that the curve for the zinc
ethyl silicate coating in figure 13a exhibits a similar shape to that explained
by Abreu <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a>. However the change in potential is 55mV
in figure 14a and as it is below �1000mV/SCE after 50 days this is by no means
a complete curve and the protection given by the zinc pigment would last for a
much longer time period.</p>

<p>&sect;62 Figure 13b shows the affect of 15% bare steel on the
coating. The move towards the potential of steel is greatly increased compared
to that of a completely covered panel. This illustrates how in high zinc
content coatings the particle to particle to substrate contact is maintained to
provide protection to an exposed area. If the exposed steel were several
magnitudes smaller in size it would be expected that the zinc corrosion product
would cover the small gap in the coating. When the area is large, such as in
the above research, then the protective capacity of the zinc is reduced to
protecting the exposed area and being rapidly used up. This would have a
detrimental influence on the formation of any barrier by the corrosion products
of zinc.</p>

<p>&sect;63 Lindquist, Meszaros and Svenson <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> studied eight commercial zinc rich primers
in an electrochemical investigation, of which four were of the ethyl silicate
type. The potential of the systems was taken during immersion in aerated 0.1M
sodium chloride solution, approximately 0.6% by weight sodium chloride. The
four coatings were made up with zinc contents of 83%, 87%, 91% &amp; 93% by
weight. The change of potential with respect to time can be seen in figure 14.</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 width=366 height=226

<p align="center">&sect;64 <b>Figure 14 � Potential vs. time for exposure in 0.1M sodium
chloride solution for four commercial ethyl silicate zinc rich coatings on
steel <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;65 It can be seen that the 87% and 91% by weight zinc coatings
were no longer protecting the steel at the end of the test as they exceeded the
protection potential of �780mV/SCE. The 83% and 93% by weight zinc coatings
were still protecting the steel by cathodic protection at the end of the test.
The authors make brief comment as to the possible differences in performance,
namely different vehicle formulations and incorporation of extenders. As these
formulations are not given it is difficult to obtain any useful comparative
understanding of the mechanisms taking place between the coating systems.
However, each curve does show the expected shape and the authors comment on the
complete loss of cathodic protection in the worst performing coatings. The
authors state that after being exposed for a week the solid zinc metal was
white in colour due to the formation of corrosion product and the ethyl
silicate zinc rich coatings were also �more or less� covered in white deposits.
They go on to say that this white deposit was due to the corrosion of the zinc
particles at the surface of the paint film and X-ray diffraction showed the
white deposits to be a mixture of several zinc compounds including Zn<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O
and Zn<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>. As stated
earlier in comments on the mechanism, Lindquist <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> says that the corrosion protection of
these coatings lasts longer than the period of galvanic activity. However, no
details of sample condition at the end of the test were given.</p>

<p>&sect;66 Feliu et al <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a>, <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> considered the performance of ethyl silicate
zinc rich coatings that cover a wider range of zinc content. The composition of

<p>&sect;67 The coatings were applied to a dry film thickness of 50-60mm
and were exposed by immersion in 3% by weight sodium chloride solution. The
performance by measurement of potential with respect to time was shown to be
quite different for the levels of zinc used in the exposure (figure 15)</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 width=286 height=232
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image032.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;68 <b>Figure 15 � Potential vs. time for three different zinc
ethyl silicate coatings immersed in 3%wt sodium chloride solution <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;69 The potential curves (figure 15) show that the coating
containing 50% by weight zinc does not attain a potential at which it can
provide cathodic protection to the steel substrate. It is stated, however, that
it provided protection for 1 day. Unless problems occurred with the data
collection or the reproduction of the data this statement of the protection
provided is not verified by data. If the development of the potential with time
curve explanation of Abreu <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a> is followed, then the initial drop in
potential could have been missed in the data collection. Although it is fair to
say that with lower zinc contents it would be expected that this trend of
potential moving towards that of zinc will be extremely short-lived.</p>

<p>&sect;70 A difference of 6% by weight zinc between the higher-level
zinc coatings shows a large difference in the cathodic protection performance.
The 84% by weight coating maintains a potential lower than �900mV for 110 days
whereas the 78% by weight coating maintains this potential for 20-40 days. This
would appear to show the importance of higher zinc content when concerned with
the performance of these zinc rich coatings in exposure media such as 3% by
weight sodium chloride solution.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>&sect;71 There are a number of different parameters available when
monitoring potential with time. These can include variables such as exposure
media, zinc content, film thickness and substrate condition (smooth or rough).
When considering performance it is important that it is related to the
conditions of exposure. Table 4 shows the conditions, where available, of the
research completed by the authors discussed in the above section.</p>

<p>&sect;72 The performance can be compared, with regard to the exposure
conditions, by using the time to reach the protection potential of steel. This
is where the cathodic protection of the steel by the zinc is no longer
effective. This is summarised in table 4.</p>

<p>General observations:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <SCRIPT>comment(74)</SCRIPT><li>As
     zinc content is increased, the time taken to reach E<sub>prot</sub> is
     increased. This can be seen through the work of Feliu <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a>,
     <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>. No inferences can be made from the work
     of Lindquist due to the differing composition of the individual coatings
     within the study. The difference in time to reach E<sub>Prot</sub>
     observed between the work of Scantlebury <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a>
     and Feliu <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a>, <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>
     can also said to be a consequence of the
     different composition. It can be seen that the film thickness used is
     similar and the exposure media is quoted as being the same but the time to
     reach E<sub>Prot</sub> of the 63% by weight coating is as long as, if not
     greater, than that of the 84% by weight coating.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(75)</SCRIPT><li>As
     the film thickness is increased, the time taken to reach E<sub>Prot</sub>
     is increased. This can be seen through the work of Armas <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> who used two
     different film thicknesses with the same coating within the study.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(76)</SCRIPT><li>The
     variety of exposure media used shows that there is no standard method of
     test exposure generally used. Much of the work would be completed using a
     set of solutions so that information can be related to that of the
     literature. It may be inferred however, that Armas <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> has aimed to model
     the real conditions of exposure that this type of coating would need to
     perform in. It is this point that is considered later when the exposure
     regime of this research is detailed.</li>

<h3>The role of zinc content in the formation of corrosion products</h3>

<p>&sect;77 As stated earlier, the zinc content has a direct affect on
the performance of the zinc silicate coating systems. It has also been
established that the initial protection mechanism of this type of coating is
through cathodic protection and that the level of zinc content is of great
importance. This level of zinc content influences the overall
particle-to-particle-to-substrate contact. Work done by Morcillo et al <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> offers a schematic representation of the
type of conduction pathways within the coating (figure 16). This is dependant
on the amount of zinc within the coating that allows the pathways to form.</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 width=371 height=327
src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/image034.gif"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;78 <b>Figure 16 � Schematic representation of electronic (A &amp;
B) and ionic (C, D &amp; E) conduction pathways within a zinc rich silicate
coating <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a></b></p>

<p>&sect;79 Pathways A &amp; B depend upon the zinc content of the coating,
which in reality is much thicker than the above representation. This ensures an
electrical connection between the zinc anodes and steel cathode. Pathways C, D
&amp; E are ionic conduction paths formed by macro- or micro-cracks and voids
between the particles or in the binder. The electrolyte then fills these areas
and contributes to ionic conduction.</p>

<p>&sect;80 Morcillo et al <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>
go on to present SEM micrographs of
unexposed coatings with zinc levels of 84% and 50% by weight zinc. These are
shown in figure 17.</p>

<p>&sect;82 Observing figure 17 it is apparent that there is a higher
number density of zinc particles in (a) thus increasing the particle contact.
The zinc particles in (b) are very much individual in nature with little
contact with surrounding zinc particles. It is this level of zinc content (as
in (b)) that the subject of a recent publication <a
href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a>
in this journal. Morcillo et al. <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> go on to describe the formation of
corrosion products in these coatings. It is stated that the zinc particles will
only be the site of the anodic reaction of the corrosion process when in
contact with the steel substrate, where the cathodic reaction takes place. The
corrosion product is said to form some way from the zinc particles, in the
capillaries full of electrolyte that facilitate the ionic conduction between
the anodic and cathodic zones. These capillaries are said to form in the
favourable conditions in ethyl silicate binders with high amounts of zinc
present. The wetting of the particles by the binder is of particular
importance. Termed �pseudo-wetting�, the non-polar nature of the ethyl silicate
binder makes it difficult to wet the zinc particles, as opposed to binders of
the epoxy type that wet particles relatively easily (termed �effective
wetting�).</p>

<p>&sect;83 Ginsberg <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> illustrates the binder distribution in
zinc rich ethyl silicate coatings. An idealised approach suggests a particle
completely surrounded by a uniform thickness of binder (figure 18a). When
considering the contact between particles Ginsbergsuggests a
meniscus of binder is formed between particles due to the surface tension
(figure 18b)</p>

<p>Morcillo <script>crossref(34)</script> idealises the position of corrosion
product formation when the zinc is in contact with the substrate, as explained
above, illustrated in figure 19. When the zinc is isolated the corrosion
process is located on the same surface i.e. the zinc particle wetted by the
electrolyte. Morcillo states that the corrosion products form in the locality
of the particle, which increases the electrode polarisation and reduces the
zinc corrosion rate (figure 20)</p>

<p>&sect;89 It has been said by a number of authors <script>crossref(27)</script>,
<script>crossref(29)</script>, <script>crossref(31)</script>, <script>crossref(32)</script> that the protection afforded by zinc pigmented
coatings is longer than the period of cathodic protection suggests. There are a
number of suggested reasons as to this extended protection.</p>

<p>&sect;90 It has been suggested that there are two stages of
protection: cathodic protection followed by barrier formation. The
investigation into barrier properties is usually carried out using
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS is generally used with
organic coatings but its use with inorganic zinc coatings will be shown.</p>

<p>&sect;91 The use of EIS with coatings, especially organic coatings,
is well established <a href="#_edn40"
name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a>, <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a>
and is frequently presented <a href="#_edn42"
name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a>.
The use of EIS with zinc containing coatings is said to produce results unlike
any other type of coating <script>crossref(30)</script>.</p>

<p>&sect;92 Lindquist <script>crossref(26)</script> in a study of commercial zinc containing
coatings found that, in general, following 60 days immersion the coatings
exhibited little galvanic action. This was founded by a high
impedance/resistance inferring low galvanic activity. The extended protection
by the coatings was attributed to the inhibitive properties of the zinc salts
produced during the cathodic protection stage. The extended performance was
also said to be influenced by a high pH (9) in the film. </p>

<p>&sect;93 Feliu <script>crossref(30)</script>, <script>crossref(31)</script> states that the corrosion protection mechanism
in zinc-rich coatings is in the first instance cathodic protection, followed by
a barrier effect of the coating pores being sealed by corrosion products. </p>

<p>&sect;94 The use of EIS by Feliu shows the changing shape of the
Nyquist plot illustrating the resistance of the film. An example of this is
given in figure 22.</p>

<p align="center">&sect;95 <b>Figure 22 � Evolution with time of impedance diagrams
(Nyquist) for zinc-rich silicate coatings in 3.5% by weight sodium chloride
solution, from Feliu&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&sect;96 It is stated by Feliu that the coatings are currently in the
cathodic protection stage where the high frequency arc and low frequency tail
(figure 22) correspond to the zinc coating behaving as a porous electrode.</p>

<p>&sect;97 Once the coatings have passed the cathodic protection stage,
Feliu <script>crossref(31)</script>  states that the interpretation of the high
frequency arc and low frequency tail changes (figure 23). It is then said to
show the insulating characteristics of the binder and the zinc corrosion
products on the zinc and steel.</p>

<p align=center><img border="0" src="{{ $htmURL }}v3p18files/walsh2.gif" width="651" height="506"></p>

<p align="center">&sect;98 <b>Figure 23 - Evolution with time of impedance diagrams
(Nyquist) for a zinc-rich silicate coating containing 84% by weight zinc in
3.5% by weight sodium chloride solution, from Feliu <script>crossref(31)</script></b></p>

<p>&sect;99 It is stated by Feliu <script>crossref(30)</script> that an increase in time of the chord
length of the higher frequency arc may be attributed to a rise in the
resistance of the coating due to:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <SCRIPT>comment(100)</SCRIPT><li>Incorporation
     into the coating of insoluble and protective zinc corrosion products.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(101)</SCRIPT><li>An
     increase in the average thickness of the insulating layer on zinc
     particles electrically connected to the base steel.</li>
 <SCRIPT>comment(102)</SCRIPT><li>A
     decrease in the number of zinc particles connected to the base steel.</li>
</ul>

<p>&sect;103 The results of his work lead Feliu <script>crossref(31)</script> to conclude that there is a reinforcing of
the barrier effect with zinc contents greater than 90% by weight, when the zinc
content drops to below 70% by weight there are fewer possibilities for a
barrier to develop and last, and at 50% by weight zinc there is no barrier
formation.</p>

<p>&sect;104 Scantlebury <script>crossref(28)</script> states that there is a combination of
further protection within zinc-rich silicate coatings. It is said that the
extended period of protection is due to the inhibitive effect of zinc salts at
the surface combined with pore blocking by the corrosion product.</p>

<p>&sect;105 There is an agreement between Abreu <script>crossref(33)</script>, Real
<script>crossref(36)</script> and Szauer <script>crossref(35)</script> that a pore blocking mechanism by the voluminous zinc
corrosion product produced in the cathodic protection stage attains the barrier
effect.</p>

<h3>The effect of zinc content</h3>

<p>&sect;106 The zinc content and its particle size is important in
determining the extent of cathodic protection in a zinc-rich silicate coating.
This is due to the relationship of specific surface area and the desire for
electrical continuity<a name="_Ref521138967"></a> <a
href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a>. The effect that the zinc content
has on the cathodic protection within the coatings has said to be governed by
the binder and pigment material used <script>crossref(28)</script>, <script>crossref(43)</script>.</p>

<p>&sect;107 Theiler <script>crossref(39)</script> states that there is an optimum zinc
content for each type of binder material used.�
Too much zinc results in a large anodic area compared to the cathodic
area and a small current density is drawn from the active zinc. This low
current density allows the zinc to passivate by not changing the pH within the
film and the protective action is lost. A small anode area would result in a
high current density and the zinc would be used rapidly.</p>

<h4>The PVC/CPVC ratio</h4>

<p>&sect;108 The pigment volume concentration/critical pigment volume
concentration (PVC/CPVC) is of great importance to the successful performance
of inorganic zinc-rich coatings. As has been stated, contact between pigment
and substrate is necessary to establish cathodic protection. If the ratio is
too low then there is total encapsulation of the pigment particles by the binder
and inter-particle contact is minimal <script>crossref(12)</script>. The number of internal pores within the
film is also insufficient to promote galvanic activity. Too much zinc would
afford cathodic protection to the steel but with the risk of having too little
binder to keep the pigment on the steel substrate. The zinc pigment would also
be exposed and have an increased corrosion rate that would lead to a shorter
life of the coating.</p>

<p>&sect;109 However, it can be said that inorganic zinc rich primers are
less susceptible to the requirement for specific loading<a name="_Ref521139057"></a><a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a>. The binder used is said to react
with the coating and substrate rather than encapsulation as with organic
binders. The inorganic film is strong, inert, adhesive and heat resistant as
well as being quite porous. This porosity allows for electrolyte to pass
through before barrier properties take effect. </p>

<h4>Zinc particle size</h4>

<p>&sect;111 The particle size of the zinc within the coatings has an
effect on the amount of zinc that is available to provide cathodic protection <a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a>.
The zinc content available for cathodic protection is said to be highest when
the mean particle size is 2-3mm.</p>

<p>&sect;112 Montes <a href="#_edn46"
name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a>
states that the influence of particle size distribution on zinc dust in water
based inorganic zinc-rich coatings is dependent on the desired viscosity of the
coating. Some particle sizes are said to be too fine, others too coarse and it
would appear that a mixture is required.</p>
