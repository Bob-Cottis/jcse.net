  <p>The effect of aluminium and glass barrier pigments on cathodic disbonding
  of epoxy coatings has been studied. Over a two years period, cathodic
  disbonding has been measured for nine model coatings with various
  concentrations of aluminium or glass pigments. The binder in the model
  coatings was either epoxy or epoxy mastic. The test specimens were exposed in
  natural seawater and polarised to -1050 mV SCE with zinc anodes. The pigments
  had a large effect on cathodic disbonding. Coatings without barrier pigments
  disbonded significantly during the test period. Coatings with 10% aluminium
  pigments or more did not show any sign of disbonding until the end of the
  test. Then some samples had about 3 mm disbonding around the damage in the
  coating. Coatings with 10% or more glass pigments had a very long delay time
  before disbonding started, but disbonded severely after that. Possible
  mechanisms of the effects are discussed.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>Cathodic disbonding is one of the most important mechanisms for loss of
  adhesion between coating and steel. The problem has lately received new
  attention due to the increased use of coatings in combination with cathodic
  protection of offshore oil production installations. Resistance against
  cathodic disbonding is an important property of the coating systems to be used
  on submerged structures. E.g. the NORSOK standard for development and
  operation of oil fields in the Norwegian sector use resistance against
  cathodic disbonding as a criterion for prequalification of coatings for this
  application [1].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>The purpose with this paper is to examine the effect of flake shaped glass-
  and aluminium pigments on cathodic disbonding. Model coatings with various
  contents of glass and aluminium pigments have been prepared and tested for
  cathodic disbonding. The conditions we have used are close to the conditions
  found on offshore installations in the North Sea. We have found that both
  glass and aluminium pigments improve the resistance of the coatings against
  cathodic disbonding. The effect was found with two different binders which
  indicate that this is a general effect, independent of the binder. We have
  outlined two possible mechanisms for the effect. The first possibility is
  improved barrier properties of the coating. Cathodic disbonding depends on
  transport of reactants through the coating. The barrier pigments may then
  impede the transport, which may slow down the cathodic disbonding. The other
  possibility we have looked at is buffering reactions with the pigments.
  Leidheiser <i>et al.</i> have suggested that the aluminium may reduce the pH
  at the coating/substrate interface and thereby decrease cathodic disbonding
  [2].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Aluminium pigments have been widely used in engineering paints and
  protective coatings for many years. The aluminium pigments are shaped as
  flakes in different sizes. The pigments we have used are about 20 - 40 �m
  wide and 1 �m thick. This geometry, along with their metallic nature, is
  responsible for most of their properties in protective paints. The aluminium
  pigments improve the barrier properties of protective paints [3,4]. From a
  corrosion protection point of view, their ability to impede the transport of
  water and oxygen is the most important property. The pigments are impermeable
  to water and oxygen, and the diffusion is forced to go around the particles.
  This may increase the diffusion path significantly and thereby decrease the
  permeability through the paint [3]. In addition the pigments also act as
  barriers to radiation, as they reflect both IR, UV and visible light [3]. This
  increases the stability of the paint, and may also reduce heat radiation from
  the substrate. Aluminium pigments are commercially available as leafing or
  non-leafing grades. The leafing pigments float to the surface of the applied
  film, while the non-leafing pigments are evenly distributed in the film after
  application. The different behaviour is due to surface treatment of the
  pigments with different fatty acids.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>Glass flake pigments are also used in protective coatings, but not to the
  same extent as aluminium flake pigments. They are produced by breaking thin
  glass (about 5�m thick) into small flakes, about 100 - 400 �m wide. Their
  relatively large size restricts them to be used in very thick coatings only.
  The shape and impermeability to water and oxygen suggest that glass flakes
  will improve the barrier properties of the coating. Glass flake pigments have
  received little attention in the literature. Foster <i>et al</i>. have
  described some of the basic characteristics of glass flake filled coatings
  [5]. El-Sawy <i>et al.</i> have tested the effect of glass pigments in a
  scratch test and an environmental exposure test [6]. However, the glass
  pigments they used gave no positive effect on the performance of the coatings.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>The mechanism for cathodic disbonding is not known in every detail.
  However, it is widely accepted in the literature that high pH at the
  steel/coating interface is responsible for the disbonding [2,7,8]. The high pH
  is produced by the cathodic reaction on the steel surface under the coating.
  Structures in seawater protected by zinc- or aluminium anodes are polarised to
  between -800 and -1100 mV SCE. At these potentials the cathodic reaction can
  be both reduction of oxygen and hydrogen evolution:</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><p>Leidheiser have shown that above -1000 mV SCE the oxygen reduction
  dominates, while below this potential the hydrogen evolution dominates [9].
  However, in the cathodic areas under the coating the potential is probably
  well above -1000 mV SCE, due to the high resistance between the anode and the
  cathode. Leidheiser have therefore concluded that the oxygen reduction is the
  predominant reaction under the coating [9].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>Ritter <i>et al.</i> have measured the pH under the disbonded coating and
  found that it could be as high as 14 [10]. The exact consequence of the
  alkaline water film is not known, but three theories have received most
  attention. The three mechanisms are based on different locus of failure: in
  the iron oxide on the steel surface [2,10], in the coating [11,12] or at the
  interface [8,13].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>The transport of reactants for the cathodic reaction under the coating has
  also been subject to much research. Most paint films are permeable to both
  oxygen and water [14]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these
  reactants mainly are transported through the film. Leidheiser <i>et al.</i>
  have also shown this experimentally [2]. For cations, the conclusions are less
  clear. Several researchers have concluded that the transport of cations goes
  laterally from the holiday under the disbonded coating [2,15]. The time
  dependence of the disbonding is an indication for this. The disbonded area is
  usually found to increase proportionally with time, i.e. the disbonded
  distance from the holiday in the coating is proportional with the square root
  of time [2,15-17]. As the disbonded area increases, the distance for transport
  of ions under the disbonded film to the disbonding front also increases.
  Therefore the resistance to the transport of cations increase and the rate of
  disbonding will decrease. However, there are also those who have found
  indications for transport of cations through the coating. Skar measured the
  disbonding of coatings with film thickness between 100 and 300 �m and found
  that the disbonding rate decreased linearly with film thickness [18]. He also
  found that the transport of cations was rate limiting. He therefore suggested
  that the transport of cations went through the disbonded film. Jin<i> et al. </i>[16],
  Leidheiser [19] and Parks <i>et&nbsp;al. </i>[20]<i> </i>have also concluded
  that cations might be transported through the coating when the specimen is
  under cathodic polarisation.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>Many researchers have studied the rate determining step in cathodic
  disbonding. Leidheiser, among others, have shown that the transport of oxygen
  through organic coatings is much lower than the transport of water [21].
  Oxygen may therefore for some coatings be rate limiting for cathodic
  disbonding. However, for most coatings researchers have found that the
  transport of cations are rate limiting. When cathodic disbonding is measured
  in different electrolytes (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl etc.), they have found that
  the rate of disbonding is linearly proportional to the mobility of the ions in
  water [2,15,18,22].</p>
  <h3>Experimental</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>We have used model coatings with two different binders: an amide cured
  epoxy and an amine cured epoxy modified with a hydrocarbon resin (epoxy
  mastic). The epoxy binder was pigmented with different concentrations of
  aluminium flake pigments. The epoxy mastic binder was pigmented with either
  aluminium flake pigments or glass flake pigments. The aluminium pigments we
  have used are about 20 - 40 �m wide and 1 �m thick. The glass flake pigments
  were up to 400 �m wide and 10 �m thick. Information about composition and
  pigmentation of the paints is given in Table 1 and 2.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Cathodic disbonding for all nine model coatings was tested in a long term
  test. The substrate was 200 x 200 x 5 mm steel plates cut from mild steel (DIN
  17100). The composition of the steel was 0.10% C, 0.10% Si, 0.52% Mn, 0.14% P,
  0.014% S, 0.23% Cr and Fe to balance. They were blast cleaned with steel grit
  to Sa 21/2 [23] and medium roughness (R<sub>y</sub> = 76 � 7 �m) [24]. The
  paints were applied by airless spraying in two coats. The first coat cured for
  about 24 hours at room temperature before the second coat was applied. After
  that, the samples cured for 55 days at ambient temperature and humidity before
  testing. Coating thickness was measured with a magnetic gauge. The accuracy of
  the instrument is better than 10%. The dry film thickness is given in Table 1
  and 2. The samples were given a circular holiday in the middle, 6 mm in
  diameter, to start the cathodic disbonding process. They were exposed in
  continuously running natural seawater at 8-13�C. Galvanic coupling to zinc
  anodes gave cathodic polarisation to about -1050 mV SCE in the coating
  holiday. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1A. Cathodic disbonding was
  measured destructively by gently lifting the disbonded paint film off the
  steel substrate with a scalpel. The diameter of the disbonded circle was
  measured in four directions and the disbonded distance was calculated from the
  average diameter.</p>

  <h4>Effect of aluminium pigments on cathodic disbonding</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(19)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 2 shows the disbonding distance in the long term test as a function
  of time, for the amide cured epoxy coatings with aluminium pigments. 15
  samples of each model paint were prepared, and cathodic disbonding was
  measured during a two years period. With increasing time intervals, 1-3
  samples was removed and analysed. The aluminium pigments were highly effective
  in improving the resistance of the coating towards cathodic disbonding. Epoxy
  10 and Epoxy 20 had not disbonded at all after 18 months of exposure. After
  two years Epoxy 10 had some disbonding, and about 3 mm of the coating around
  the holiday could be removed. Epoxy 5 disbonded about 20 mm and Epoxy 0
  disbonded about 65 mm in the same period of time.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>The aluminium not only affected the rate of disbonding, but also the degree
  to which the coating lost adhesion. For Epoxy 5, it was much harder to remove
  the disbonded coating, compared to Epoxy 0. This was also seen when we looked
  at the metal surface in a microscope after removing the disbonded coating.
  Under Epoxy 5 we found more &quot;islands&quot; where the coating still
  adhered to the substrate, compared to Epoxy 0, where very little of the binder
  was left on the steel surface.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 3 shows the amount of coating still found on the steel surface after
  removing the disbonded coating on samples of Epoxy 0 and Epoxy 5. The pictures
  were created and analysed in an electronic image analyser. The sample in
  Figure 2A was coated with Epoxy 5 and exposed for 18 months. The radius of the
  disbonded circle is about 32 mm. The quantitative analysis showed that
  remainings of the coating covered about 18% of the disbonded area. The sample
  in Figure 2B was coated with Epoxy 0 and exposed for one year. The radius of
  the disbonded circle is about 120 mm. For this coating only 4% of the
  disbonded area was covered with remainings of the binder.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(24)</SCRIPT><p>The coatings with high aluminium concentrations had little or no disbonding
  after two years in the long term test. To get quantitative information about
  how much the aluminium pigments decreased cathodic disbonding, we also tested
  the amide cured epoxy coatings in a short term test on ground steel. In
  general the rate of cathodic disbonding increases when the roughness of the
  substrate decreases [8]. Epoxy 10 and Epoxy 20 disbonded faster on ground
  steel. Figure 4 shows the rate of cathodic disbonding on ground steel as
  function of aluminium content. The disbonding rate for Epoxy 10 and Epoxy 20
  is about the same, but more than two decades slower than for Epoxy 0. The time
  dependence of the disbonding is different from the parabolic kinetics that
  usually is found, e.g. in Figure 2. This may indicate that some other
  mechanisms are involved, but we have not been able to investigate this.
  However, the results clearly demonstrate effect of the aluminium pigments.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(25)</SCRIPT><p>The surface roughness had a large effect on the disbonding rate. On ground
  steel substrate (R<sub>y</sub> = 5 �m) Epoxy 0 disbonded 25 mm in about one
  day. On blast cleaned steel (R<sub>y</sub> = 76 �m) it took about three
  months to get the same disbonded distance. Watts and Castle have also tested
  the effect of substrate roughness on the rate of cathodic disbonding [8]. They
  suggested that the effect of the substrate roughness was due to a change in
  the diffusion path length under the coating. As the substrate roughness
  increased the diffusion path length between the holiday and the disbonding
  front would increase. They found a reasonable correlation between the
  disbonding rate and the actual length of the surface profile. The effect may
  also be due to an increase in the contact area between the coating and the
  substrate, when the surface roughness increases [16]. When we measured
  cathodic disbonding on a substrate that had been abraded in one direction
  only, the disbonded distance was always larger along the abrasion lines. Jin<i>
  et al. </i>found the same [16]. This observation favours the mechanism
  suggested by Watts and Castle.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(27)</SCRIPT><p>The amide cured epoxy has low commercial interest due to the high content
  of solvents. The epoxy mastic binder was therefore included in the test to
  represent a more commercially interesting binder. The disbonding distances for
  the epoxy mastic coatings are given in Figure 5. Pre-treatment, application,
  curing and exposure were similar to the long term test of the amide cured
  epoxy. The unpigmented epoxy mastic gave about 8 mm disbonding in four months,
  but then the coating started to blister randomly all over the sample. After
  that, cathodic disbonding spread from the blisters, and it became impossible
  to measure the disbonded distance from the holiday. After about one year the
  whole sample had disbonded. We would like to emphasise that this is not a
  general problem with epoxy mastics. We have tested several commercial epoxy
  mastics which have perform much better than this.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(28)</SCRIPT><p>The blistering of Mastic 0 was independent of the initial coating holiday,
  and was even found on the back of the samples. Inside the blisters we found a
  highly alkaline liquid, which means that the blistering was caused by the
  cathodic reaction under the coating. The blistering was therefore also a kind
  of cathodic disbonding. It then seems that there are two different disbonding
  mechanisms, one mechanism associated with a mechanical damage in the coating,
  and another mechanism independent of any mechanical damage. This is in
  accordance with Type I and Type II failure described by Watts and Castle [26].
  Type I failure was associated with downward diffusion of the cation via
  conductive pathways in the film, corresponding to the random blistering of our
  coatings. Type II failure was associated with transport of the cation under
  the disbonded coating from a mechanical damage in the film. For the epoxy
  mastic coatings the aluminium pigments had a positive effect on both types of
  failure.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p>As for the amide cured epoxies, the epoxy mastics with 10% and 20%
  aluminium pigments (Mastic 10 and 20) had no cathodic disbonding at all after
  18 months exposure. No blistering or other signs of coating deterioration were
  observed either. Due to the low content of solvent, the concentration of
  aluminium in the dry film was lower than for the corresponding amide cured
  epoxies. Since the unpigmented coating performed so badly, the aluminium
  pigments had a tremendous effect on both random blistering and cathodic
  disbonding.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p>In the amide cured epoxy coatings the pigment volume concentration (PVC)
  varied from 22% in Epoxy 0 to 31% in Epoxy 20 (Table 1). We could therefore
  suspect that the effect of the aluminium just was a general effect of the
  increased PVC. However, for the epoxy mastic coatings the PVC was 33% for all
  the five paints. The effect of the pigments on cathodic disbonding can
  therefore not just be a general effect of the PVC.</p>
  <h4>Effect of glass pigments on cathodic disbonding</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p>Due to spark hazard, the classification companies have set a limit to the
  concentration of aluminium in marine paints to maximum 10% by weight in the
  dry film [27]. Glass flake pigments were therefore also tested with the epoxy
  mastic, as an alternative barrier pigment. The disbonding of these coatings is
  also shown in Figure 5. The glass flakes inhibited the disbonding compared to
  the unpigmented coating, but not as much as the aluminium pigments. After 4
  months some disbonding was found on Mastic 10G. For Mastic 20G disbonding was
  first found after a year of exposure. After 9 - 10 months disbonding started
  from random points all over Mastic 10G, and after one year it was impossible
  to measure the disbonded distance from the holiday. After 18 months about 70%
  of the coating had disbonded. For Mastic 20G some random initiation of
  disbonding was first found after 18 months.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(33)</SCRIPT><p>The random initiation of cathodic disbonding of Mastic 10G and Mastic 20G
  was probably due to opening of conductive pathways through the coating, as for
  the blistering of Mastic 0. The reason why Mastic 10G and Mastic 20G did not
  develop blisters may have been a reinforcing effect of the glass flake
  pigments. The random initiation of disbonding for the two films was therefore
  also a Type I failure, in the terminology by Watts and Castle . Since this
  type of failure was delayed by the glass flake pigments may, the pigments may
  have delayed the process of opening conductive pathways through the film.</p>
  <h4>Mechanism for the effect of the pigments</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(34)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 6, 7 and 8 show SEM micrographs of cross sections of Mastic 0,
  Mastic 10A and Mastic 10G. Immediately after application, the flake shaped
  aluminium and glass pigments mainly orient themselves parallel to the
  substrate. In Figure 7 and Figure 8 they therefore appear as needles aligned
  parallel with the substrate. The irregular shaped particles in all three films
  is the filler. The aluminium and glass flakes are assumed to improve the
  barrier properties of the coating by increasing the diffusion pathway through
  the coating [3]. The diffusing species (oxygen, water and ions) are forced to
  go around the impermeable particles, and this may increase the diffusion
  distance several times. The use of barrier pigments can therefore be seen as
  an alternative to increasing the film thickness. However, the aluminium and
  glass flakes may also increase the diffusion through the coating. If some
  pigment flakes are aligned perpendicular to the substrate they may introduce
  effective pathways for diffusion through the coating. This is extra risky with
  the glass pigments since they are so large that one pigment flake may
  penetrate the whole film. Coatings with such pigments must therefore always be
  applied thicker than the diameter of the largest pigments.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(38)</SCRIPT><p>Pigments in general, and flake shaped pigments in particular, may also
  affect the curing of the binder. If the pigments impede diffusion, the curing
  agent may not be able to diffuse to the reactive sites on the binder chains
  around the pigment particles. This may then leave a partly cured resin around
  the pigment particles, which may serve as preferred routes for diffusion. If
  the resin does not adhere properly to the pigments small voids may be formed
  around the particles. This may also increase the diffusion through the
  coating.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(39)</SCRIPT><p>The initiation of cathodic disbonding from random points underneath the
  glass pigmented films may have been caused by the pigment flakes. They were
  wider than the film thickness, and some of them may have been aligned
  perpendicular to the substrate as described above. However, the films were
  applied in two coats, which should reduce the chance for pigments to penetrate
  the film. Since the unpigmented film performed so badly, it is more likely
  that the random initiation was due to the binder.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(40)</SCRIPT><p>The barrier effect of the glass and aluminium flake pigments is the most
  obvious explanation for their effect on cathodic disbonding. The effect of the
  barrier pigments can be compared to the effect of increasing the film
  thickness, which also has been shown to decrease cathodic disbonding
  [2,16,18]. The effect of the aluminium pigments can also involve another
  mechanism. Leidheiser <i>et al.</i> have suggested that the oxide on the
  surface of the pigments may act as a buffer [2]. The Pourbaix diagram for
  aluminium shows that aluminium corrodes at pH higher than about 9. The oxide
  on the surface dissolves in high pH environment and can not protect the metal.
  The reaction removes hydroxide from the electrolyte, and this may reduce the
  pH at the steel/coating interface:</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  <SCRIPT>comment(41)</SCRIPT><p>Since cathodic disbonding has been attributed to the build up of hydroxide
  at the steel coating interface, this reaction may therefore decrease the rate
  of disbonding. Another possibility for the effect of aluminium pigments is
  that they act as an oxygen scavenger. The corrosion of the aluminium pigments
  may consume the oxygen before it reaches the steel surface. Since the
  aluminium is not passive, due to the high pH, the corrosion of the pigments
  (4) is not inhibited:</p>

  </center>
  <SCRIPT>comment(42)</SCRIPT><p>Glass is also known to be unstable in highly alkaline solutions, but this
  requires very high pH, and will probably not affect the pH under the paint
  film significantly. The fact that the glass pigments also decreased the
  disbonding weigh against the active pigment theory. However, the two
  mechanisms may work in combination. Both aluminium and glass pigments may act
  as barriers. The aluminium pigments was more effective than the glass pigments
  in decreasing cathodic disbonding, which may be due to the buffer effect in
  addition to the barrier effect. Both the barrier mechanism and the buffer
  mechanism will be investigated in detail in Part 2.</p>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(43)</SCRIPT><p>Aluminium and glass barrier pigments decreased cathodic disbonding
  substantially for two different epoxy coatings. After exposure in natural
  seawater for two years, coatings with 10% aluminium pigments gave about 3 mm
  disbonding, while the coatings without the aluminium pigments disbonded about
  65 mm. Glass flake pigments were less effective than aluminium pigments in
  decreasing cathodic disbonding, but still they improved the performance of the
  coating significantly. The aluminium- and glass pigments act as barriers to
  diffusion of oxygen and water through the film. However, if transport of
  cations under the disbonded film is rate limiting, the barrier mechanism alone
  can not explain the reduced disbonding rate. For the aluminium pigments, a
  mechanism where the aluminium acts as a buffer that reduces the pH at the
  steel/coating interface is possible.</p>
