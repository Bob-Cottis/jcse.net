  <p>Epoxy coated aluminium 3003 H14alloy panels were examined for
  susceptibility to filiform corrosion under both humid and immersed conditions.
  The panels were not artificially damaged, but were artificially contaminated
  with sodium chloride. Significant filiform corrosion was found to occur at 84%
  relative humidity (RH). However, the extent of filiform corrosion was greatly
  reduced at 100% RH. Extensive filiform corrosion was also noted for samples
  immersed in 1% NaCl solution, especially during the early stages of exposure,
  and in glycerol:water mixtures. If a cross-cut specimen is examined under
  immersion conditions, severe filiform corrosion rapidly occurs, before
  steadily converting to general under film corrosion, especially in the
  vicinity of the cross-cut. The results clearly show that aluminium 3003 H14
  alloy can undergo filiform corrosion under immersion conditions.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>One of the most common forms of corrosion occurring on coated aluminium and
  aluminium alloys is filiform corrosion. While this form of corrosion rarely,
  if ever, leads to a working failure, the consequences can be severe for any
  decorative function[1]. In appearance, filiform corrosion on aluminium alloys
  resembles long thin thread like filaments, often up to several centimeters
  long, but less than 1 milimeter wide. The filaments are generally white, with
  a grey head. This head forms the active corrosion site, with corrosion
  propagation and filament growth taking place here.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>Filiform corrosion is often induced by the presence of chloride salt
  contamination on the aluminium surface. As described by Slabaugh <i>et al</i>[2],<i>
  </i>the head of the filament usually contains significant quantities of
  chloride ions, with little or no free chloride in the long tail. Any chloride
  present in the tail is tied up as an aluminium oxychloride. The chloride
  containing electrolyte appears to move forward with the head as the filiform
  corrosion progresses across the aluminium substrate.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Two primary filiform corrosion mechanisms are put forward in the
  literature[2,3,4,5]. These consist of a cathodic delamination mechanism,
  discussed by Funke[3], and an anodic undermining mechanism, as proposed by
  Ruggeri and Beck[4]. Lenderink[5] believes that the first mechanism is
  generally thought to be more important for steel, and the second for aluminium.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><p>Aluminium 3000 (Al-Mn) alloys are most often used in the manufacture of
  cooking utensils and in the canning industry[6], although some limited use as
  an architectural material also occurs. These are two areas where a retention
  of the visual and cosmetic properties of the coated product is extremely
  important.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(7)</SCRIPT><p>It has been generally accepted that filiform corrosion only occurs under
  humid conditions. However, the authors have attended a number of public
  presentations where speakers described observing &quot;filament like&quot;
  structures under immersion conditions on lacquered aluminium surfaces,
  especially with respect to food and drink cans. However, the speakers were
  extremely reluctant to describe this as filiform corrosion because &quot;filiform
  corrosion does not occur under immersion conditions&quot;. This publication
  examines the tendency of epoxy coated aluminium alloy 3003 H14 to undergo
  filiform corrosion under a variety of humid and immersed conditions.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>The as received sample panels were rinsed with de-ionised water and
  degreased with acetone. They were then contaminated at the centre of the panel
  with a 5&mu;l droplet of 0.1g/L sodium chloride
  solution using a micro pipette. This gives 0.5&mu;g
  of contamination. Upon drying the contaminated zone was of approximately 2mm
  diameter. The panels were then coated with a 50&mu;m
  wet thickness coating of a 2-pack epoxy/polyamide clear lacquer coating (Epilife/H
  Marcel Guest, Manchester, U.K.) using the draw bar technique. The curing
  regime consisted of 48 hours at room temperature followed by 48 hours at 60<sup>o</sup>C.
  The resultant coating was of 20-25&mu;m thickness.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>Coated samples were exposed to relative humidities of 84 and 100% at 28-29<sup>o</sup>C.
  Samples were also immersed in 1% sodium chloride solution, 1% hydrogen
  chloride solution or 1:10 glycerol:water mixtures. The samples were generally
  undamaged, but some cross cut specimens were also examined in 1% sodium
  chloride and 1% hydrogen chloride solutions.</p>
  <h3>Results</h3>
  <h4>84% RH</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 1 shows examples of epoxy coated aluminium 3003 H14 panels exposed
  to an environment of 84%RH. Only a very limited amount of filiform corrosion
  can be observed, with only a small number of filaments growing from the
  contamination site.</p>
  <h4>100% RH</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Little or no evidence of filiform corrosion was observed at this humidity.
  Some general corrosion and blistering occurred in the vicinity of the
  contamination spot.</p>
  <h4>Immersion in 1:10 water:glycerol</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 2 shows an example of a sample exposed under immersion to 10:1
  water:glycerol. An area of general corrosion surrounding the central
  contaminated area is clearly visible after 7 days. However, beyond this
  region, filiform corrosion is clearly observed to have occurred at 14 days. An
  area of general corrosion has lead to the initiation of filiform corrosion.</p>
  <h4>Immersion in 1% sodium chloride solution - intact specimen</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(15)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 3 shows an example of a specimen immersed in 1% sodium chloride
  solution. Here, filiform corrosion initiates around the general corrosion in
  the contamination zone. However, with time further general corrosion
  initiates, spreading across the area affected by filiform corrosion. Filiform
  corrosion was far more extensive than that observed on any of the samples
  exposed to humidity.</p>
  <h4>Immersion in 1% sodium chloride solution - cross-cut specimen</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(16)</SCRIPT><p>Figure 4 shows an example of a cross-cut specimen immersed in 1% sodium
  chloride solution. The cross-cut is surrounded by a region of general
  corrosion. This region is surrounded by extensive filiform corrosion after 35
  days of exposure, covering most of the available exposed area.</p>
  <h4>Immersion in 1% hydrogen chloride solution &#150; scribed specimen</h4>
  <SCRIPT>comment(17)</SCRIPT><p>Samples were partly immersed in 1% hydrogen chloride solution. Within the
  immersed region, general corrosion rapidly initiated, with undermining of the
  coating occurring within 48 hours. However, filiform formation occurred at the
  scribed defect in the region above the immersion line. Figure 5 shows a region
  of a specimen immediately above the immersion line after 21 days of exposure.
  General corrosion is beginning to advance from the scribe cut into the region
  where filiform corrosion has occurred.</p>

  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(20)</SCRIPT><p>It is not the purpose of this publication to give a detailed mechanistic
  interpretation of filiform corrosion, or to give anything more than a general
  indication of corrosion rates in the environments examined. The primary
  objective is to establish whether filiform corrosion occurs under immersion,
  as opposed to humid conditions. From specimens exposed to 84% humidity, it is
  noticeable that there is only a limited level of filiform corrosion, even
  after 8 weeks of exposure. When the relative humidity is raised to 100%,
  little or no filiform corrosion is present. This would seem to be in agreement
  with the theories generally put forward for the initiation and propagation of
  filiform corrosion, where a humidity range of 60-95% RH is suggested[2-5]. The
  indication would be that filiform corrosion would not occur under immersion
  conditions, as these would be representative of 100% RH, when a liquid water
  film would form on the sample surface. However, the authors have attended a
  number of public presentations where speakers described observing
  &quot;filament like&quot; structures under immersion conditions on lacquered
  aluminium surfaces, especially with respect to food and drink cans. However,
  the speakers were extremely reluctant to describe this as filiform corrosion
  because &quot;filiform corrosion does not occur under immersion
  conditions&quot;.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(21)</SCRIPT><p>When the corrosion of these panels is examined under immersion conditions
  it is apparent that the conventional theory has some flaws. For intact panels
  immersed in both 1% sodium chloride solution and 10:1 water:glycerol, general
  corrosion occurs in the vicinity of the salt contamination. However, beyond
  this region extensive filiform corrosion is observed. The level of filiform
  corrosion is substantially greater than that noted for any of the specimens
  exposed to humidity. When the scribed panels immersed in 1% sodium chloride
  solution are examined, general corrosion occurs at the scribe, but severe
  filiform corrosion can be noted in the surrounding zone. Filiform corrosion
  clearly <b>can </b>occur<b> </b>for this aluminium alloy under immersion
  conditions where the water activity is close to unity, and under conditions
  where the water activity is rendered less than unity by the use of
  water:glycol mixtures.</p>
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(22)</SCRIPT><p>Filiform corrosion can occur on epoxy coated aluminium alloy 3003 H14 under
  both immersed and humid conditions.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>Also, filiform corrosion is far more extensive under the immersion
  conditions examined, compared to the humid conditions.</p>
