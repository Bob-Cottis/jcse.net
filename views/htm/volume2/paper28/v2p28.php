  <p>The paper describes the influence of environmental factors such as:
  ultraviolet radiation, thermal shocks, aggressive media (5% water solutions
  of: sulphuric acid, potassium hydroxide and sodium chloride) as well as
  weathering on the course of mechanical characteristics of an epoxide coating.
  It was stated that ageing processes that occur in the epoxide coating cause
  deterioration of its mechanical properties, such as: hardness, tensile
  strength as well as unit elongation. They also influence changes in mechanical
  characteristics obtained by means of dynamic mechanical thermal analyse, i.e.
  elongation and dynamic storage modulus E&#146;.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>Optimal choice of organic coatings that protect technical equipment &#150;
  during the design process &#150; requires a knowledge of wear processes of these
  coatings. Therefore, it is necessary to carry on model (accelerated) tests in
  order to predict the coating service life because multi-layer metal-organic
  coatings perform their protective role for a long time, even for fifty years.
  Unfortunately, there is not yet developed an universal accelerated test and it
  is not found the correlation between results of accelerated tests and
  weathering. Such situation results from a non-sufficient knowledge of
  destruction processes of an organic coating under the influence of ambient
  factors. The multicriterion investigations of physico-chemical properties of
  organic coatings aged under various conditions that are carried out by the
  author complete the knowledge from this field. The paper describes the effects
  of destruction of epoxide coatings aged with ultraviolet radiation, thermal
  shocks, aggressive media and weathering. The effect of these factors on the
  course of mechanical characteristics was estimated as well. The author uses
  the investigation results for prediction the organic coating service life.</p>
  <h3>Investigation Methods</h3>
  <b>
  <h4>Materials and Sample Preparation</h4>
  </b>
  <SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><p>The model investigated coating was made of chemically resistant epoxide
  paint. The main components of this paint were: epoxy resin Epidian 119,
  pigments (iron oxide red), fillers (barium sulphate, microtalk) and diluent (ethyloglicol).
  Polyaminoamide was used as the curing agent. Its mass fraction (calculated
  stoichiometrically) amounted 30% of the whole composition. After addition of
  the curing agent the paint was stirred for half an hour and then, after two
  hours, the coating application started. Three-layer coatings were obtained by
  means of air operated spraying on the polyester sheeting as an apparent base.
  The layers were cured in two stages: at 20<sup>o</sup>C for 24 hours and at
  120<sup>o</sup>C for 0.5 hour. The samples were acclimatised before testing
  (according to the Polish Standard PN-86/C-81510) for 10 days at ambient
  temperature 20<sup>o</sup>C and at relative humidity (65�5)%.</p>

  <h4>Ageing Conditions of the Epoxide Coating</h4>
  </b>
  <SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>Destruction kinetics of the epoxide coating aged with 5% water solutions of
  sulphuric acid, potassium hydroxide and sodium chloride as well as ultraviolet
  radiation, thermal shocks and weathering was investigated. The ageing
  conditions are presented in Table&nbsp;1. After ageing samples were washed
  with distilled water and then &#150; after wiping with absorbent paper &#150; dried
  for 24 hours at the temperature 20<sup>o</sup>C.</p>

  <h3>Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation on Chemical Ageing of the Epoxide Coating</h3>
  <SCRIPT>comment(9)</SCRIPT><p>The changes occuring with time in the chemical structure of the epoxide
  coating superficial layer were studied in infrared spectroscopy
  investigations. It was found an increase of absorption of infrared radiation
  in the range 1800-1392&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> what indicates ageing processes of
  the epoxide. The band 1800-1552&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> included in this range
  represents oxidation products [1�3]. It contains the band that represents
  carbonyl group vibration. In case of the epoxide coatings aged with thermal
  shocks, weathering and with 5% water solutions of sodium chloride or potassium
  hydroxide it was stated an increase in carbonyl group intensity in the band
  1807-1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> &#150; with the maximum at 1740 cm<sup>-1</sup>.
  Coatings aged with ultraviolet radiation were characterised by the highest
  carbonyl group intensity (in the whole measured range) and the band
  representing these groups was 1807-1640&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> &#150; with the
  maximum at 1717 cm<sup>-1</sup> [1]. The band of carbonyl groups was not found
  in the range of 1807-1640&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> in case of unaged coatings and
  coatings aged with 5% water solution of sulphuric acid [1]. The increase of
  infrared absorption observed in the bands 1472-1424&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> and
  1391-1344 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the increase of amount of CH<sub>3</sub>
  groups that are formed as a result of bond cleavage in epoxide. Increase of
  infrared absorption in the band 1422-1392 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponds to the
  increase of amount of CH<sub>2</sub> groups (adjacent to carbonyl groups) what
  gives an evidence of epoxide oxidation progress [2]. The increase of intensity
  of the band having the maximum at 3400&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> with ageing time
  was also found. This band represents valence vibration of hydroxyl group [1,
  3].</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(10)</SCRIPT><p>It results from the total absorbance characteristics obtained with the use
  of infrared spectroscopic investigations that the ageing changes in the
  chemical structure of the superficial layers of the epoxide coating are
  non-homogenous. The most intensive ageing is due to ultraviolet radiation. The
  profilometric and microscopic investigations proves, however, a non-homogenous
  physical wear (cracking, pigment and filler spalling) of the epoxide coating
  surface under the influence of ambient factors. The results of microscopic
  investigations allow to state that number and size of the cracks depend on the
  ageing kind. For instance, cracks generated under the influence of 5% water
  solution of sulphuric acid were, in general, in the shape of rings with the
  diameter of 40 to 90 &mu;m
  m (for 1008 h ageing) situated around blisters. These cracks showed tendency
  to become larger with ageing time. However, cracks generated under the
  influence of other media were in the shape of bands 150 to 190 &mu;m long and 2.5 to 10 &mu;m wide. 
  In the case of ultraviolet
  radiation action, number and size of the cracks increased with ageing time.
  Moreover, these cracks were characterised by silver shines in the reflected
  light of an optical microscope what was observed in case of weathering too.
  Shape and shine of these cracks were similar to the &quot;silver cracks&quot;
  described by I.&nbsp;Narisava [4] but they were ten times wider.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>Substantial chemical and physical ageing effects of investigated epoxide
  coatings was caused by the action of 5% water solution of sulphuric acid as
  well as UV radiation what, in particular, can be seen analysing the courses of
  thermogravimetric characteristics. The greatest decreases of the decomposition
  start temperature as well as the most intensive thermal decompositions
  (Fig.&nbsp;1) were found for these ageing kinds in the whole ageing range (the
  measurements were done after 240, 360, 744 and 1008 hours).</p>

  were caused by the action of ultraviolet radiation (Fig. 3, 4).</p>

  structure as a result of the loss of coherence with the epoxide. This kind of
  ageing contributes also to the greatest decrease of the coating hardness
  (Fig.&nbsp;5). After 1008 hour ageing the coating hardness decreased by more
  than 25%. In case of other ageing kinds the observed hardness decrease was
  from 5 to 13% - except for the ageing with thermal shocks, when the hardness
  had almost the constant value.</p>

  <SCRIPT>comment(23)</SCRIPT><p>The highest tensile strength was obtained after ageing with ultraviolet

  coating showed high embrittlement what made carrying on the investigation
  impossible because the coating ruptured when being fixed in the tensile
  testing machine. The lowest tensile strength &#150; in almost the whole range of

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <b>
  <h4>Run of mechanical characteristics of the epoxide coating substantially
  depends on the ageing kind.</h4>
  </b>
  <SCRIPT>comment(30)</SCRIPT><p>Ageing of the epoxide coating causes deterioration of its mechanical
  properties, such as: hardness, static tensile strength, unit elongation. It
  also influences changes in mechanical characteristics obtained using dynamic
  mechanical thermal analyse, i.e. elongation and dynamic storage modulus E&#146;.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(31)</SCRIPT><p>Embrittlement of epoxide coatings increases with ageing time. It is also
  affected by the kind of ageing. The coating aged with ultraviolet radiation
  showed the highest embrittlement. It resulted from significant oxidation
  degree of the epoxide.</p>
  <SCRIPT>comment(32)</SCRIPT><p>As a result of ageing of the epoxide, pigment and filler particles lose
  coherence with it and are spalled from the coating structure. This results in
  an increase of the coating roughness. The coating aged with ultraviolet
  radiation showed the highest roughness.</p>
