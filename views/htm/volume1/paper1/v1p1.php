<p>Samples of iron were exposed during 1993 in two batches; firstly over the
summer and early autumn, and also during the winter and early spring periods.
In each case, and as intended, a large majority of the samples were covered in
thick adherent corrosion product &quot;rust&quot; after the end of the
exposure period. However, and unexpectedly, a few samples from each batch
remained visually uncorroded retaining their original bright appearance. This
observation is presented as an interesting insight into, and as supporting
evidence for, mechanisms of atmospheric corrosion of iron involving
passivation.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Recently, there has been increased interest in the detailed mechanism of
atmospheric corrosion of iron. This has been driven particularly by the
application of novel techniques of investigation from the group of Stratmann
in Germany [1-5]. Results from this work have re-emphasised the importance of
redox cycles, which occur during wetting and drying episodes, first identified
by the earlier work of Evans [6]. Thus, it is now relatively well-established
that atmospheric corrosion of iron is intermittent, proceeding when the
surface is wet (with a corresponding drop in potential into the active state)
and stifling by surface passivation when drying (with a rise in potential of
up to or, more than, 0 mV SCE) [1,7,8]. This, then, reveals a picture of a
metal in which the normal, passive, state is, from time-to-time interrupted by
bursts of corrosion during wet episodes.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><p>The original aim of the atmospheric exposures described herein were to
  prepare a natural rust film in order to investigate its electrochemical
  behaviour in-situ. When several electrodes refused to corrode after 4 months
  we repeated the exposure to confirm the effect. This short communication
  reports the observations made and provides a comment on likely reasons.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(4)</SCRIPT><h4>EXPERIMENTAL METHOD</h4>
  <p>High purity iron (99.99%) was obtained from Goodfellow Metals in the form
  of wire 0.5 mm in diameter. Short lengths of this wire were then used to
  prepare semi-micro electrodes, initially for atmosphere exposure but
  ultimately for electrochemical measurements, as follows. Each cut section was
  initially coated over its length using a thin layer of epoxy adhesive; this
  was done to avoid subsequent crevicing of the electrode. After curing for 48
  hours at 25&deg;C, the wires were then mounted in standard metallographic moulds
  using an epoxy resin. After full curing, the electrodes were polished to 800
  grit on SiC paper, dried and stored in a desiccator prior to exposure.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(5)</SCRIPT><p>An initial batch of ten samples was prepared and exposed for 4 months
  commencing on June 1st, 1993. Subsequently, a further batch of sixteen samples
  was prepared and placed outdoors for 3 months commencing February 20th, 1993.
  Samples were thus exposed outdoors, unsheltered and in a garden environment,
  over the summer and early autumn periods as well as (separately) during the
  winter and early spring. The weather was typical of Manchester for the time of
  year; i.e. generally cool and damp. After exposure, the samples were removed
  from the exposure site on a dry day, dusted with a soft artists' brush, and
  stored in a desiccator over dry silica gel prior to photography.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(6)</SCRIPT><h4>OBSERVATIONS AND DISCUSSION</h4>
  <p>Examination of the first batch, i.e. that exposed for 4 months during the
  summer and early autumn, indicated that one of the samples was visually
  uncorroded (bright). All the other samples in this batch were corroded to a
  similar degree. As this was such an unexpected occurance, this first
  observation was initially discounted and the specific sample discarded.
  Nevertheless, a second batch of samples was exposed and examined at more
  frequent intervals in case the phenomena repeated and, if so, to obtain an
  estimate of the onset of corrosion. Thus, after 3 months, two (out of sixteen)
  samples remained apparently uncorroded (bright) with the balance corroded as
  expected.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><br>Figure 3 shows the other bright sample at higher magnification. The bright samples all
  show scratches from the initial grinding (it should be remembered that the
  samples were not polished). On close inspection it can be seen that the
  &quot;bright&quot; samples do, in fact, have evidence of corrosion product on
  their surfaces. Thus, in Figure 3, very small, darker areas on be seen
  although, to the naked eye, they could not be discerned. About 20-30% of the
  surfaces of the two bright samples were slightly darkened in this way, with
  70-80% completely of the surface completely bright.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>That bare, untreated iron remains largely uncorroded and passive for
  several months in a Northern temperate climate is a remarkable result. The
  reasons for the observations can only be speculative at this stage. In
  particular, the small size of the exposed area is clearly important as a
  macroscopic surface could be normally expected to develop a visible patina of
  rust in a few hours or days depending on the weather. Another factor is the
  relatively high purity of the iron which limits the presence of second phase
  particles, especially sulphides. A third reason may well be the wire form of
  the metal as heavy drawing will tend to reduce the dimensions of secondary
  phase particles and string them out.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>Whatever the reason, this observation is strong evidence that the corrosion
  on iron and steel in the atmosphere proceeds by disruption of an initially
  passive film and that the film is normally repairable under conditions of
  atmospheric exposure.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><h4>CONCLUDING REMARKS</h4>
  <p>About 10-14% of high purity iron wire samples, exposed to the atmosphere
  for periods of up to 4 months, remain uncorroded. This retained passivity is
  evidence that atmospheric corrosion on iron proceeds by disruption of a
  passive film and, under normal conditions, the film is self-repairing.</p>
