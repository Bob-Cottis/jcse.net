  <p>Values for the activity coefficient of the chloride ion in pore water
  solution when added as sodium chloride has been produced from electromotive
  force data using a silver/silver chloride ion selective electrode.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(2)</SCRIPT><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances steel reinforcement in concrete is in a passive
  condition due to the high pH environment provided by the hydration of cement.
  One of the causes of the break down of this passivity is attack by chloride
  ions <a href="refs.php#r1">[1]</a>. Currently common methods of finding the
  level of chlorides in a structure involve destructive techniques. The
  potential of silver\silver chloride electrodes depends mainly on the chloride
  ion activity in the surrounding electrolyte, and therefore it should be
  possible to use these electrodes as a non-destructive method of obtaining the
  chloride ion activity in cement and concrete structures. The term activity is
  used to explain the deviation in electrolytic properties of real solutions
  from ideal solutions and is related to the general concentration and
  interaction of ions in solution, the more concentrated the solution the
  further the activity will deviate from the concentration, the difference
  usually being described in the form of an activity coefficient, i.e. activity
  = coefficient x concentration. In very dilute solutions the activity
  coefficient is assumed to be unity, but since concrete pore water is
  approximately pH 13.6 this assumption may not hold and so the activity
  coefficient must be determined experimentally from a knowledge of the
  activity. Also before using a silver/silver chloride electrodes in
  cementitious media it is necessary to ensure that they function in a
  predictable manner. The purpose of this paper is to first prove this and then
  to determine the activity coefficient in a simulated pore solution.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(3)</SCRIPT><h3>Method</h3>
  <p>Silver/silver chloride electrodes were prepared in a manner similar to that
  described in Ives and Janz<a href="refs.php#r2">[2]</a>. 25mm long sections
  of 99.99% pure, 1mm diameter silver wire supplied by Goodfellow Metals of
  Cambridge were taken and soldered onto screened cables. Heat shrink tubing was
  cut to an appropriate length and applied to cover the connection between the
  silver and the cable. These electrodes were then wiped with aceto ne to
  degrease them and anodised at a current density of 0.4mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for
  approximately 30 to 40 minutes then moved to an aqueous solution of potassium
  chloride for storage. A molar solution of sodium chloride was added to 100ml
  of deionised water using a one ml graduated pipette with a least count of 0.01
  ml. The exact amount of solution added was recorded and the solution was
  stirred for approximately one minute. Four silver/silver chloride electrodes
  were then rinsed with deionised water and immersed into this solution and
  their potential against a saturated calomel electrode was recorded. The
  saturated calomel used was in a Luggin probe arrangement, with the probe
  containing agar agar with 0.1M ammonium nitrate as a salt bridge. Another
  known quantity of 1M NaCl solution was added and the experiment was repeated
  until a reasonable range of chloride concentrations were obtained. A simulated
  pore solution, as used by Yonezawa et al <a href="refs.php#r3">[3]</a> of a
  similar composition to that found by Diamond<a href="refs.php#r4">[4]</a>,
  containing 0.4M KOH and 0.2M NaOH was then used as the base electrolyte and
  the experiment repeated. The complete procedure was then repeated to avoid any
  cumulative or weighing errors that may have occurred.</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(8)</SCRIPT><h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p>Figure 1 shows the potentials of the silver/silver chloride electrodes
  used, measured against a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). From this data the
  activity of the chloride ion can be calculated by straightforward mathematical
  manipulation of the Nernst equation:</p>

<SCRIPT>comment(11)</SCRIPT><p>The potential of the saturated calomel electrode has been calculated at
  values ranging from 0.2412 V<a href="refs.php#r5">[5]</a> to 0.2467 V<a href="refs.php#r6">[6]</a>.
  The effect of this variation would be to change the gradient of the line
  produced in a plot of activity against concentration. It was therefore decided
  to take already published data on the activity coefficients <a href="refs.php#r7">[7]</a><a href="refs.php#r8">[8]</a>,
  and calculate the potential of E<sub>ref</sub> by fitting the curve produced
  from the deionised water data to the published activity coefficients. The
  potential for Eref produced in this manner was then used in equation 2 to
  calculate the activity of the chloride ion in simulated pore solution and
  hence find the activity coefficients of the chloride ion in this solution. The
  data produ ced in this manner is illustrated in figure 2, along with the data
  the curve was fitted to. The resulting standard potential for the saturated
  calomel electrode used was found to be 0.2412 V. The maximum deviation between
  silver/silver chloride electrodes was 3mV at the lowest concentrations used,
  at higher concentrations the maximum deviation between electrodes was less
  than 1mV. This suggests a larger error in very dilute solutions, a reasonable
  statement. This is also supported by the fact that the silver\silver chloride
  electrode took longer to reach a stable potential in the most dilute solution,
  yet were almost instantly stable in the higher concentrations.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(12)</SCRIPT><p>Table 1 shows the values of activity coefficients in the simulated pore
  solution. These were found by dividing the calculated activity of the ions in
  solution by the known concentration of ions in solution.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(13)</SCRIPT><p>The most common method of finding the concentration of chloride ions in use
  is that of pore water expression, as described by Longuet<a href="refs.php#r9">[9]</a>
  whereby a cylinder of concrete is subjected to triaxial loading and the
  solution obtained in this manner is then analysed. Since the quantity of
  solution obtained in this manner is small, usually not more than 5cc, it is
  diluted between 25 and 100 times before analysis. The so lution is then
  analysed for OH<sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration in various ways.
  Most commonly used is titration with nitric acid for the OH<sup>-</sup>
  concentration and with silver nitrate for the chloride ions, as used by Page
  in several papers <a href="refs.php#r1">[1]</a><a href="refs.php#r10">[10]</a>.
  Some authors<a href="refs.php#r11">[11]</a> <a href="refs.php#r12">[12]</a><a href="refs.php#r13">[13]</a>
  however have used chloride sensitive electrodes in order to find the chloride
  concentration, or pH electrodes <a href="refs.php#r14">[14]</a> for the
  hydroxide ion concentration. Both these methods give activity rather than
  concentration, as mentioned by Tritthart<a href="refs.php#r14">[14]</a> who
  found that a glass electrode gave a value of activity of 10<sup>-0.45</sup>,
  whereas the measured concentration of hydroxide ions was 10<sup>-0.2</sup>
  which would suggest an activity coefficient of approximately 0.56. Hausmann <a href="refs.php#r15">[15]</a>
  stated that the probability of steel corrosion in concrete was dependant
  mainly on the ratio of chloride to hydroxide ions in solution. Since the above
  authors all quote this figure an error with a magnitude of approximately 0.5
  must occur in those that have determined the activity of one s pecies and
  compared it with the concentration of the other. This does not occur when
  comparing concentration with concentration because the activity coefficient is
  in fact the mean activity coefficient of all ions in the solution.</p>
<SCRIPT>comment(14)</SCRIPT><h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The activity coefficient of the chloride ion when added as sodium chloride
  to a simulated pore solution ranges from 0.75 at a concentration of 0.01M to
  0.45 at 0.12M. Silver silver chloride electrodes provide the possibility of
  measuring chloride concentrations in cement and concrete non destructively.</p>
